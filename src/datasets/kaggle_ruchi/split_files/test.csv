Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-28T14:53:04.717+03:00,the bundy verdict is another defeat for obama,"obamas un ambassador cuba is right about our human rights october   daniel greenfield 
you may remember ambassador samantha power from the time she proposed invading israel since then shes gone on to a glorious career of representing the castro regime at the un or is it the obama regime it naturally gets confusing when the us ambassador to the un sides with the enemy against her own country 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you 
under obama power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the united states and they say obama is some sort of antiamerican traitor i dont see it if he were we would be seeing signs of it by now 
anyway power then went on to audition for the job of the un ambassador from cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal communist dictatorship about our human rights are wellfounded 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust 
somehow though siding with communist dictatorships who are the enemy while betraying our allies in the region does not create any mistrust only opposing the left does",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/bald_biden.jpg?itok=jGd4tHnq,hate,1.0,weiner sexting yearold girl leads new fbi investigation hillary emails,huma abedin swore oath emails lied anything resembling rule law huma would jail people federal investigations gone jail much lower acts dishonesty deception rebooted fbi investigation hillary clintons emails spurred emails turned anthony weiner sexting investigation emails huma abedin swore gave new information fbi found state departmentrelated email home laptop also calls question whether abedin fact turned devices used send receive email working state june abedin said oath sworn deposition looked devices thought contained government work records could given state department records subsequently reviewed fbi go searching records may possession returned state department attorney ramona cotca judicial watch asked looked devices may state department work returned returned gave attorneys review relevant documents gave devices paper abedin answered anyone really surprised huma abedin lied real question whether held accountable,1.0

Beau Albrecht,2016-11-16T04:00:00.000+02:00,the sad saga of john walker lindh rebel without a clue,"in an excerpt of a john pilger special interview julian assange says that emails released by wikileaks show that hillary clinton is intentionally misguiding voters about the degree to which us allies are supporting isis and that donald trump will not be allowed into the oval office
assange explains that the same financial interests funding isis are funding clinton he references a  email from john podesta to clinton in which we find the following
while this militaryparamilitary operation is moving forward we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of qatar and saudi arabia which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil and other radical sunni groups in the region

i think this is the most significant email in the whole collection said assange all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis
pilger asked assange about the possibility that trump would steal the election with the help of russia as many in the democratic party claim
assange thinks that this is highly unlikely but not because he is unpopular my analysis is that trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because he has had every establishment off his side trump does not have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them establishment he explained
assange says that hillary is the establishment pick banks intelligence arms companies foreign money etc are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and the journalists themselves delivered by the daily sheeple

Kim Petersen,2016-10-30T02:00:00.000+02:00,an eight point brief for voting to avoid corporate evil,"gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads  shares  
amateur footage emerged on saturday showing what appears to be turkish soldiers executing two female pkk insurgents at pointblank range 
almasdar news that released the footage says they are not able to independently verify it 
a ceasefire between turkey and the pkk ended last year and clashes have since claimed hundreds of lives on both sides 
the pkk operates primarily in the mountanious terrain of southeastern turkey and often uploads footage of its kurdish fighters ambushing turkish government troops more erdogan vows heavy price for coup plotters 
the tension between kurdish fighters and turkish government have always been high in past years in yet one of the most recent cases a turkish court banned the coleader of turkeys prokurdish opposition from traveling abroad as part of a court case in which she has been accused of being a member of an armed terrorist group hurriyet daily reported on saturday reuters reported 
figen yuksekdag cochair of peoples democratic party hdp is facing jail time up to  years over comments she made last year in the southeastern border town of suruc the prosecutor of the case requested the ban 
hdp described the courts decision to bar yuksekdag from foreign travel as political and arbitrary saying in a statement that it will make a formal appeal for its overturn 
the move comes days after the comayors of diyarbakir the largest city in the southeast were detained as part of a security crackdown turkeys largely kurdish southeast has been rocked by violence following the collapse of a ceasefire between the state and the kurdistan workers party pkk last year 
president tayyip erdogan has accused the hdp of being a political extension of the outlawed pkk and repeatedly called for the prosecution of its members he has also said the removal of elected officials and civil servants accused of links to the pkk was a vital part of the battle against it 
several other hdp lawmakers including cochair selahattin demirtas are also being prosecuted largely over terrorism charges after the parliament earlier this year lifted the immunity of hdp deputies along with the immunity of mps from other parties 
meanwhile three turkish soldiers were killed and five others were wounded by mortar fire from pkk militants near the southeastern town of cukurca security sources said 
soldiers who were on an operation in cukurca in hakkari province bordering iraq and iraq returned the fire sources said operations were under way to hunt down the militants

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-27T04:50:26.351+03:00,project veritas ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago,"realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep john bennett ventures where few dare to tread october   robert spencer 
in an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative john bennett of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed 
on tuesday bennett held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america 
this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism 
and so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  
gaubatz and guandolo presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since imad enchassi the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas 
guandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence 
predictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against bennett rep bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep bennett as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community 
the world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates 
but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection 
john bennett and the people of oklahoma deserve better there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc bennett dared to raise them tuesday for that he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in  these concerns are more urgent than ever 
the media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated please email the speaker of the oklahoma house jeff w hickman politely and courteously expressing your support for john bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series his email is email protected and his phone number is

conflict there to an end and combat isis will only draw the us into a larger war trumps remarks come as he trails clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from election day youre not fighting syria anymore youre fighting syria russia and iran all right russia is a nuclear country but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk he said trump id love to fight biden trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating isis or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in syria which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes he has suggested the us should allow isis antigovernment rebels and the syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with russia  which has aided the syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and usallied rebels  to combat isis assad is secondary to me to isis trump told reuters of the syrian president bashar alassad whom us officials have argued must step down clinton has called for establishing a nofly zone over syria to help bring the fiveyear civil war to an end a proposal top republicans in congress have championed which president barack obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with russia a usenforced nofly zone would mean the us could shoot down a russian jet should it enter syrian airspace clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate arguing that it would save lives and hasten the end of the conflict while cautioning that this would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the russians and the syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground clinton said during the debate earlier this month i think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the russians and syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in syria it would help us in the fight against isis trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in syria to protect civilians  as has clinton  which could also put the us in conflict with the syrian government or russia should they oppose the policy the clinton campaign later tuesday pushed back against trumps rhetoric national security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced donald trump as dangerously illprepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commanderinchief clinton spokesman jesse lehrich said once again he is parroting putins talking points and playing to

of the russian strongman asking how she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil and just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of republican majorities in congress trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of republican unity weighing down his candidacy if we had party unity we couldnt lose this election to hillary clinton he told reuters that complaint didnt put trump in more of a bipartisan mood though as the republican nominee also told reuters he would not consider

this is the best picture in human history 
it is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties the republic and why we are where we are 
on the left side of this picture we have donald trump  a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian the new presidentelect of the united states he points his fingers and smiles that apprentice smile as he makes a point 
on the right side of this picture we have barack obama  a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant he sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office and obama rightly looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes 
behind obama sits a bust of abraham lincoln his eyes downcast mourning for his country 
yep 
greatest picture ever 
this is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant barack obamas image of himself is not accurate  to americans obama is a reality tv show star he transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfiestick celebrityridden sinkhole of hollywood glitterati hobnobbing with glozell and macklemore cracking wise about the presidency with jimmy kimmel before saying that a reality star like trump could never be president 
this picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost as obamas former pastor might put it 
and then theres lincoln 
lincoln who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration mourning behind barack obama who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain 
lincoln who represented wisdom mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd given republicans domination of the senate and the congress i have hopes for trumps presidency  i hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises  but trump occupying lincolns office is at best a jarring visual

Corey Savage,2016-11-14T19:00:00.000+02:00,ways to forge strength through challenges,"after this october surprise donald trump only has one option left expose the clinton crimes michael on television democrats are now calling for a revolution in the streets and i believe that they are quite serious by michael snyder on november th  
the surprise victory by donald trump on november th has spawned a series of violent protests and riots all over the nation as stunned leftists continue to throw the largest postelection temper tantrum in us history protesters in large cities all across america have been disrupting public transportation looting stores hurling objects at the police and burning trump in effigy there have even been shootings at antitrump rallies in seattle and in portland  hundreds of protesters have been arrested so far and organizers are promising that this is only just the beginning meanwhile large numbers of enraged leftists are physically threatening trump on twitter  and some are even calling for a violent revolution sadly i believe that they are quite serious about this 
even some big celebrity names are starting to use the word revolution in messages to their followers on twitter katy perry has ominously warned that  the revolution is coming  and comedian sarah silverman has boldly declared that  trump gets a chance to hear us or else we r them if he fails revolution in the streets  
of course other leftists are seeking less violent ways to oppose trump there is a major push to use the electoral college to block a trump presidency if that fails there are many hoping to immediately impeach trump once he takes office and other activists such as former labor secretary robert reich are calling for a new third party if their planned postelection takeover of the democratic party is not successful 
but for many on the radical left the time for patience is over the not my president movement is taking off like a rocket and one survey found that only  percent of all clinton supporters consider trumps victory to be legitimate a protest near trump tower in new york city on saturday drew approximately  people and usa today reported that the antitrump protest in portland oregon on saturday night rapidly  devolved into a riot  
it is becoming clear that these protests are not going away any time soon and some are even beginning to refer to this movement as the purple revolution  
no sooner had trump been declared the  th president of the united states sorosfunded political operations launched their activities to disrupt trump during obamas lameduck period and thereafter the swiftness of the purple revolution is reminiscent of the speed at which protesters hit the streets of kiev the ukrainian capital in two orange revolutions sponsored by soros one in  and the other ten years later in  
as the clintons were embracing purple in new york street demonstrations some violent all coordinated by the sorosfunded moveonorg and black lives matter broke out in new york los angeles chicago oakland nashville cleveland washington austin seattle philadelphia richmond st paul kansas city omaha san francisco and some  other cities across the united states 
so could we actually see a violent revolution on the streets of america 
is the radical left really so horrified by the prospect of a trump presidency that they would actually be willing to engage in a prolonged campaign of chaos violence and physical intimidation 
well the oath keepers are so concerned about what this movement could become that they have initiated an intelligence gathering operation that they are calling operation hypo  
clearly as oath keepers we cannot simply sit around and watch while the enemies of liberty work to use violence to initiate a communist revolution in our country as a result of the intelligence being provided by our operation sabot operatives we have initiated operation hypo we have allowed our personnel to burrow deep inside these protest organizations to collect information regarding tactics motivations schedules and logistics 
we had operatives at the planning meetings for the protests that occurred last evening in baltimore md and philadelphia pa  our operatives have also penetrated numerous other planning organizations in cities across the country for opsec reasons the precise list of cities we are operating in will not be publicly disclosed 
and one thing that we already know is that the radical left is hoping to organize the largest political protest in united states history in washington dc on inauguration day i will be writing about this later today on the most important news  
the election of donald trump has been the single most galvanizing event for the radical left that we have seen in decades one of the early leaders of the not my president movement is filmmaker michael moore and the following are three of his key action points which he feels must be implemented immediately  
 must quickly and decisively form an opposition movement the likes of which hasnt been seen since the s i will do my part to help lead this as im sure many others bernie elizabeth warren moveon the hiphop community dfa etc will too the core of this opposition force will be fueled by young people who as with occupy wall street and black lives matter dont tolerate bs and are relentless in their resistance to authority they have no interest in compromising with racists and misogynists  prepare to impeach trump just as the republicans were already planning to do with president hillary from day one we must organize the apparatus that will bring charges against him when he violates his oath and breaks the law  and then we must remove him from office  must commit right now to a vigorous fight including civil disobedience if necessarywhich will block any and all donald trump supreme court nominees who do not meet our approval we demand the democrats in the senate aggressively filibuster any nominees who support citizens united or who oppose the rights of women immigrants and the poor this is nonnegotiable 
but of course other liberals are still in the shock and disbelief stage as i have stated before americans were more emotionally invested in this election than they had been in any election in decades and the aftermath has not been pretty 
this has been particularly true on college campuses all over the nation according to the new york post  college administrators have been going to extraordinary lengths to soothe the deep emotional pain that many of their students are experiencing ?the university of michigan offered its traumatized students coloring books and playdoh to calm them are its students in college or kindergarten ?the university of kansas reminded its stressedout kids that therapy dogs a regular campus feature were available ?cornell university an ivy league school held a campuswide cryin with officials handing out tissues and hot chocolate ?tufts university offered its devastated students arts and crafts sessions ok not kindergarten  more like summer camp ?at campuses from elite yale to connecticut to iowa and beyond professors canceled classes andor exams  either because students asked or because instructors were too distraught to teach 
and it is also being reported that suicide hotlines are ringing off the hook all over the nation 
we have never seen anything like this ever before and i have a feeling that this not my president movement is going to absolutely dwarf the occupy wall street and black lives matter movements and considering the very high levels of anger frustration and pain that these radical leftists are feeling it is easy to see how this movement could become very violent 
many patriots conservatives and christians were hoping that donald trump could bring america together and lead us into a new era of peace and prosperity but the radical left already hates trump more than any president that has ever come before him 
it isnt going to take much to push the radical left over the edge and if that happens we could see endless chaos violence and civil unrest for the next four years",english,returnofkings.com,No Image

political activist and hillary supporter amal clooney traveled to texas to warn americans about our elected president donald j trump and his tough immigration policies maybe she didnt get the memotrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of gop primary contenders it wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence there will never be a president trump 
perhaps amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of american ranchers and threatened the safety and security of american citizens living in homes in or near the us mexican border towns 
amal clooney has warned that many of presidentelect trumps proposals would be violations of international law 
speaking at the texas conference for women at the austin convention center on tuesday the international human rights lawyer and wife of george clooney said she had concerns about americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans 
she noted that trumps comments during his campaign that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the us or the fact that there should be statesponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that 
the yearold wife said americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk 
i think theres some concern from abroad as to are these things actually going to happen or is the us going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally according to the hollywood reporter 
perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us 
both amal and her hollywood actor husband george a staunch hillary clinton supporter have spoken out against trump in the past 
earlier this year amal clooney called for trump to be challenged on his extreme views 
watch george clooney here whine about press giving trump too much favorable press 
when you listen to what the leading candidate on the republican side has been saying about building walls about excluding mexicans and a complete shutdown of all muslims entering in and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about muslims he kept saying they only want jihad they dont believe in our way of life they dont respect our system clooney said via daily mail",english,100percentfedup.com,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2553918-thumb.jpg,bias,1.0,wow white liberals suggest blacks stupid get idscant figure use internet video,go article political activist hillary supporter amal clooney traveled texas warn americans elected president donald j trump tough immigration policies maybe didnt get memotrumps tough immigration stance catapulted top heap crowded pack gop primary contenders wasnt long ago arrogant liberal husband announced great confidence never president trump perhaps amal shouldve traveled border towns wanted get clear picture illegal immigration affecting nation aliens crossing borders illegally destroyed property american ranchers threatened safety security american citizens living homes near us mexican border towns amal clooney warned many presidentelect trumps proposals would violations international law speaking texas conference women austin convention center tuesday international human rights lawyer wife george clooney said concerns americas reputation real estate moguls plans noted trumps comments campaign religious test imposed entering us fact statesponsored torture families suspected terrorists killed things violations international human rights law values underlie yearold wife said americas reputation country strong human rights record high moral standing risk think theres concern abroad things actually going happen us going lose moral standing internationally according hollywood reporter perhaps time put nations security sovereignty worry people countries around world think us amal hollywood actor husband george staunch hillary clinton supporter spoken trump past earlier year amal clooney called trump challenged extreme views watch george clooney whine press giving trump much favorable press listen leading candidate republican side saying building walls excluding mexicans complete shutdown muslims entering actually look specifically said infamous speech muslims kept saying want jihad dont believe way life dont respect system clooney said via daily mail,1.0

usa usa usa they chanted together in the hilton ballroom as the results came in who needs polls they never gave him a chance but now we have it president donald trump not only were the polls spectacularly wrong who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what america was thinking across its societal spectrum what it wanted what was felt deep in its blood
it is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire west has wallowed in since the s and a rejection of obama and the false hope he decried the impotent nature of us political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by crooked hillary
the world must live with it democracy has spoken and theyre going to have to get over the words president trump some will head for the hills some will run to canada others will continue to cry but as obama said yesterday regardless of the result tomorrow the sun will still shine
this is a cry for american exceptionalism and like him or not trump typifies that he is committed to education and demands high performance selling well is an admirable skill for a president to have negotiating with congress internationally etc is exceptionally useful trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose
trumps business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates  this gives him keen realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships andor antagonism between different industries and particular governments
more trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trump turkey and police tyranny the crisis of imperialism finds political expression an america in denial this vote comes down to the reckoning that for too long politicians have sold the american people out to foreign nations and global industry what donald trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying nevertrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate
although it is entirely true that trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes he brings something to the presidential table no other candidate had before he speaks his mind
america clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear they want the facts straight
president trump isnt cut from the political class that class which is entrenched in its selfinterest and has let the country down time and time again ross perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables a corrupted ethically questionable president is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and im not talking about donald trump
trump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos he is not a social engineer a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts the liberal democratic policies of obama us rep nancy pelosi us sen harry reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today
so what if his language is intemperate and insulting even lacking in nobility from time to time how can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long

was asked to make a large donation to the clintongore campaign in exchange for perks like hobnobbing with al gore and the first lady hillary rodham clinton jorge cabreras cash contributions to the clintongore campaign were so generous that cabrera was also invited to the white house and gained entrance there without any fbi  secret service security clearance inline cnn reported wednesday that cabreras attorney stephen bronis said given to the clintongore campaign was not intended to buy protection for drug smuggling he had a lobster and stone crab fishery in the keys and felt that contribution might promote that future course bronis said the clintongore campaign only returned the  last week after the full story had reached abc news and the clinton administration had been asked for comment by the media cabrera was arrested in january during a miami drug bust of nearly three tons of cocaine cabrera was arrested and pleaded guilty to one drug count he was also imprisoned in the s on narcotics charges a report that the picture of cabrera and gore had been impounded by the justice department prompted an angry reaction from republicans including bob doles presidential campaign house speaker newt gingrich and rep bob livingston of louisiana chairman of the house appropriations committee republicans sent letters to attorney general janet reno and the directors of the fbi and the secret service seeking information about cabrera and the campaign contribution livingston asked the federal agencies for a complete accounting of the facts relating to the story within

the us attorneys office in miami was contacted by reporters justice said it would not provide photographs of cabrera and gore in florida and at the white house when reporters requested them on monday the justice department attempted to claim that cabreras story is covered by the privacy act law in turning down the media request for information on the arrest for cocaine possession of tons of the illegal drug and dealing janet reno put out information that the photo of cabrera with gore and clinton could not be released without the consent of cabrera later the justice department did release the photographs after cabrera submitted written authorization the delay by the justice department appeared to be an effort to distance itself from accusations that are mounting from the american public that the justice department is receiving guidance from the clinton white house and the vice presidents office on the timing of janet renos investigation justice says it is looking into the

Henry Wolff,2016-11-05T00:24:00.000+02:00,putin condemns europes handling of migrants and says the child rape in austria shows a dilution of national values,"posted on november   how hillary courts the black vote ethnomasochism reaches a new low 
the democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the nonwhite vote as the guardian summed up one of the debates hillary clinton and bernie sanders made a conspicuous play for latino and african american voters mrs clinton won the conspicuous play hands down and with it the nomination the failure of senator sanders to win the necessary quotient of nonwhite votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out 
in february one black commenter pointedly wrote that sen sanders has many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests by may black commenter steven thrasher wrote a piece titled  bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes  and its his own fault  mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem as failing to talk about racism at every turn 
this accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered his stage to black lives matter activists several times but in comparison to mrs clinton mr thrasher was right about sen sanders no mainstream candidate in the history of the united states has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than mrs clinton since this helped her win the democratic nomination she has continued the strategy in the few days remaining before november th lets take a look at hillary clintons most ethnomasochistic moments 
 in january of  mrs clinton was at something called the iowa brown and black forum with none other than jorge ramos  where she was asked can you tell us what the term white privilege means to you and can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it this is how she began her answer 
where do i start i think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when youre standing on the shore perhaps watching     i was born white middleclass in the middle of america    
 early in the democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of bernie sanders 
whereas the electorates in iowa and new hampshire are largely ruralsuburban and predominantly white the march primary states better reflect the true diversity of the democratic party and the nation     it will be very difficult if not impossible for a democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among african american and hispanic voters we believe thats how it should be emphasis added 
 shortly before the south carolina primary at schomburg center for research in black culture in harlem mrs clinton explained how to break down barriers for african americans 
ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of usespecially those of us who havent experienced it ourselves white americans need to do a better job of listening when african americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day 
we need to recognize our privilege and practice humility rather than assume that our experiences are everyones experiences all of us need to bring our skills to bearand especially young people coming up today who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems 
 in april of  while on a back radio show mrs clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag she immediately answered hot sauce when one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer she asked hopeully is it working 
 just a few weeks after a black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers  the democratic national convention that convened to nominate mrs clinton passed a resolution no doubt with her approval supporting black lives matter  
the dnc joins with americans across the country in affirming black lives matter and the say her name efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed african american men women and children 
white politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades but this election has set a new low and if mrs clinton loses her pandering could live on in another form as the black lives matter activist tef poe explained  if mr trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go    aint no more rules weve been too nice as is",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,0.0,putin condemns europes handling migrants says child rape austria shows dilution national values,posted november hillary courts black vote ethnomasochism reaches new low democratic presidential primary one unprecedented pandering nonwhite vote guardian summed one debates hillary clinton bernie sanders made conspicuous play latino african american voters mrs clinton conspicuous play hands nomination failure senator sanders win necessary quotient nonwhite votes repeatedly pointed chattering class time dropped february one black commenter pointedly wrote sen sanders many miles go convince black voters fight interests may black commenter steven thrasher wrote piece titled bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes fault mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem failing talk racism every turn accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered stage black lives matter activists several times comparison mrs clinton mr thrasher right sen sanders mainstream candidate history united states thoroughly debased quest black vote mrs clinton since helped win democratic nomination continued strategy days remaining november th lets take look hillary clintons ethnomasochistic moments january mrs clinton something called iowa brown black forum none jorge ramos asked tell us term white privilege means give example life career think benefitted began answer start think hard swimming ocean know exactly happening around much youre standing shore perhaps watching born white middleclass middle america early democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released memo aimed stifling rising momentum bernie sanders whereas electorates iowa new hampshire largely ruralsuburban predominantly white march primary states better reflect true diversity democratic party nation difficult impossible democrat win nomination without strong levels support among african american hispanic voters believe thats emphasis added shortly south carolina primary schomburg center research black culture harlem mrs clinton explained break barriers african americans ending systemic racism requires contributions usespecially us havent experienced white americans need better job listening african americans talk seen unseen barriers face every day need recognize privilege practice humility rather assume experiences everyones experiences us need bring skills bearand especially young people coming today passion social justice helping create new ways solve intractable problems april back radio show mrs clinton asked always carries bag immediately answered hot sauce one black hosts noted would accused pandering black people giving answer asked hopeully working weeks black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers democratic national convention convened nominate mrs clinton passed resolution doubt approval supporting black lives matter dnc joins americans across country affirming black lives matter say name efforts make visible pain fellow sister americans condemn extrajudicial killings unarmed african american men women children white politicians tried win elections public displays ethnomasochism decades election set new low mrs clinton loses pandering could live another form black lives matter activist tef poe explained mr trump wins young niggas fully hell bent inciting riots everywhere go aint rules weve nice,1.0

illegal aliens are flooding through the border at an unprecedented pace according to border patrol agents the surge is taking place because human smugglers are issuing warning that its now or never to get into the us 
if trump wins the illegal aliens are told there will be a giant wall keeping them out of the us permanently if clinton wins they are led to believe amnesty will be granted both incentives are driving the illegal entries to a level not seen in years and according to agents in texas the border patrol is overwhelmed with  apprehensions per night in just one sector 
according to the department of homeland security in fiscal  the border patrol apprehended  immigrants from central america almost onethird of all apprehensions borderwide  and  more than during the socalled surge of  the agency also apprehended  haitians up from just  last year the number of immigrants claiming to be from africa and asia also is up 

when you stop somebody you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is  im here for asylum i cant go home because theyll kill me  when it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them they have a rehearsed story said chris cabrera a representative from the border patrol council told fox news once they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint well never see them again 
typically an illegal immigrant pays a  to  smuggling fee to the drug cartels once here he said the mexican government had given each a number based on their arrival

The Alex Jones Show,2016-10-28T21:12:27.535+03:00,trump votes are being flipped to clinton,"big pharma targets profits in rare diseases all of the worlds most expensive drugs are used to treat uncommon conditions image credits stocksnappixabay  
one might think big pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more wellknown diseases but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next big thing in rare diseases 
big pharmas profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments 
the search for the next moneymaker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments which may explain why they still havent discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the worlds population 
in  the orphan drug act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs werent as profitable 
because of the incentives which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees over  new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced 
for common illnesses big pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug for example liptior atorvastatin which is used to regulate cholesterol generates a sales profit of  billion with the prescription only costing patients around  per day 
but with rare diseases prices must be kept high in order to keep big pharma in business this means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures their pocketbooks are in for a hit 
for example the cystic fibrosis drug kalydeco by vertex costs individual patients  
gileads sovaldi used to treat hepatitis c cashes in at  for a paltry week course of medication 
and soliris used to treat rare blood conditions costs the patient a whopping  per year 
the list of the  most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat orphan or uncommon illnesses 
thanks to these laws that allow big pharma to charge these insane amounts of money they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows

its an obviously absurd move but considering that the doj has become a transparently political organization that abuses and attacks law enforcement on a regular basis including in the eric garner case the fbi this is just how things work in the hall of mirrors that the left has made  
the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
its silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismissexcept that bizarre and unlikely tactics no longer are there was outrage over moveons attack on petraeus and even most dems thought that it was unhelpful this attack on comey i suspect will meet with little criticism some dems will consider it a helpful preemptive move even though with his track record comey is as likely to hurt hillary as he is himself",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/huma_1.jpg?itok=1ndvuau-,hate,1.0,obamas attorney general warned fbi director inform congress new hillary investigation,media spin fbis actions deeply troubling hillarys hillary email investigation reopened due sexting investigation close aides husband media focused outrage disgust gruesome weinerabedinhillary trio fbi reporting line alternate universe left inhabits media brimming headlines attacking fbi investigating hillary hillary clinton called fbis actions deeply troubling instead media made propagandistic decision upend scandal coverage portraying fbis actions investigating hillary scandal rather hillarys actions agenda blatantly obvious also telling left decided real scandal investigating,1.0
Matthew Vadum,2016-11-01T07:32:54.394+02:00,democratic panic,"dawn perlmutter 
the war on law enforcement is epidemic every aspect of culture has been infected the antipolice disease is highly contagious and rapidly spreading on social media in memes in movements in popular fast food restaurants at football games on campuses in media and in every aspect of american culture 
an epidemic is defined as the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time colin kaepernick is the typhoid mary of the antipolice epidemic kaepernick refuses to stand while the us national anthem is being performed at the start of nfl games as a protest against alleged racial injustice and police brutality on sept  kaepernick chose to kneel on one knee as his protest gesture instead of just sitting on the bench his explanation for his decision to switch is that it was an attempt to show more respect to former and current us military members as if kneeling is somehow symbolically less offensive than sitting he misinterpreted the meaning of the military expression take a knee which occurs when troops take a pause before continuing their mission similar to hands up dont shoot the antipolice gesture has been imbued with a trendy righteousness regardless of its original meaning the media reverently refers to kaepernicks protest as taking a knee as if it is some kind of sacred act there are no headlines that read kaepernick disses the flag or kaepernick takes a crap on his country just in case his gesture didnt send a clear enough message kaepernick also uses clothing to symbolize his antipolice sympathies he has worn everything from tshirts honoring the militant black panther party to socks that depict police as pigs in addition to numerous other crimes the black panther party was responsible for the murder of at least  officers and originated the expression off the pigs meaning murder police 
like the typhoid infected cook mary mallon kaepernick is rapidly spreading the antipolice pathogen in what has been dubbed the kaepernick effect dozens of nfl and wnba players have knelt sat or raised a fist during the national anthem the disease has also spread to over  high schools  colleges and one middle school in what can only be described as a bizarre symbolic contradiction there were two incidents where women performing the star spangled banner got down on one knee in protest of what they were singing one of the women denasia lawrence not only kneeled while performing the anthem but also opened her jacket to display a black lives matter tshirt exposing miami heat fans to the contagious disorder 
rapid spread is well known for infectious diseases the antipolice disorder also contaminated the navy an unidentified sailor assigned to the naval air technical training center in pensacola florida filmed herself deliberately not standing for the national anthem and posted it on facebook she remained seated and raised a fist during morning colors and then praised colin kaepernick another sailor petty officer nd class janaye ervin an intelligence specialist in the navy reserve stationed at pearl harbor did not stand for the national anthem while in uniform she also posted a statement on facebook saying she was inspired by colin kaepernick the navy acted decisively she lost her security clearance and may be facing jail in response to her actions it is yet to be known if facing real consequences will contribute to curing the virus or accelerating it 
kaepernick is just one carrier of the antipolice disease the source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as black lives matter that originated in florida during the trayvon martin protests the disease went airborne in ferguson missouri where it was transmitted to college students professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda the symptoms are irrationality excessive anger impaired perception anxiety hatred and delusions of oppression acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior aggression paranoia loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies all indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order 
early symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers antipolice graffiti is a common symptom of the virus writing has escalated from insults such as police are murderers to threats of violence a recent popular indicator is the expression kill cops and related variations such as kill all police save a life kill a cop cops lives dont matter and shoot cops threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers heads violent antipolice rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read all my heroes kill cops put wings on pigs kill cops and cops under control or cops under flowers disturbingly antipolice graffiti protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified 
the antipolice epidemic has also spread to wellknown fast food restaurants employees have refused to serve officers at a taco bell in phenix city al dunkin donuts in west hartford ct krispy kreme in columbia sc ihop in virginia beach va arbys in pembroke pines fl chuck e cheese in bowling green ky whataburger in lewisville tx mcdonalds in brenham tx chipotle in brooklyn ny genghis grill in dallas tx noodles  company in alexandria va tropical smoothie in winter haven fl luckys teriyaki sedrowoolley wa and at the krystal restaurant in irondale al other incidents involved employees refusing to let an officer use the restroom in a philadelphia starbucks refusing service at a sunoco gas station in miramar fl writing black lives matter on an officers coffee cup at a dunkin donuts in providence ri and a walmart bakery in mcdonough ga refusing to bake a cake for a police officers retirement party these are just the incidents that have been made public 
refusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect law enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with for this reason many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made this is a legitimate concern on aug   in louisville ky five police officers were denied service at a taco bell when another employee took their orders they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying im going to mess with them which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant when officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a fullscale epidemic 
the antipolice infection went viral on social media facebook twitter instagram and other social networks have hundreds of antipolice pages ridiculing disrespecting and threatening officers protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers the following are examples of popular hashtags ftp fuck the police bluelivesmurder acab all cops are bastards bluelivesdontmatter fuckcops fuckthemall apdk all police dept killer fryemlikebacon blacklivesmatter ferguson milwaukeeuprising and kaepernick 
as the disease progresses more acute symptoms begin to manifest in acts of violence a particularly offensive indicator of the disorder is the desecration of fallen officer memorials memorials honoring officers killed in the line of duty have been attacked in philadelphia chicago albuquerque fresno denver new orleans oakland austin honolulu rochester san diego st paul covington richmond goshen fayetteville raleigh and many other cities across the country vandalism has involved everything from dousing in paint toppling and scratching granite burning to destroying a metal torch in order to extinguish the eternal flame in a previous article  i described these acts as symbolic assassinations vandals target tributes to heroic officers because they want to appropriate the valor honor and respect that they think they have been deprived of this is another symptom of the antipolice disease a sense of entitlement and resentment that leads to both symbolic and actual attacks on law enforcement officers 
at its most critical stage the antipolice disorder is lethal this is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers in the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident a pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence consequently kaepernicks gesture is neither benign nor harmless it is one symptom in a deadly epidemic",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/tr3.jpg?itok=OFI7QhAc,hate,1.0,obama wont vote america un,government truly alleviate poverty leftist policies made worse november thomas sowell political left keeps announcing new breakthrough discovery life unfair never read thomas grays elegy written country churchyard two half centuries ago economic historian david landes statement world never level playing field joint autobiography milton friedman wife rose say everywhere world gross inequities income wealth offend us fail moved contrast luxury enjoyed grinding poverty suffered others moreover professor friedman left behind foundation dedicated promoting school choice disadvantaged children could get better education better chance life political left saying think new breakthrough necessity progress important test evidence ever subjected notions one presented social vision left often nicholas kristof new york times one certain happen share vision dont get repeatedly declared mr kristofs essay growing poor america october th new york times classic example mindset left begins story poor black teenager arkansas raised single mom sometimes goes hungry home even one book television sets huge screens apparently money enough buy marijuana surely agree young fellow unpromising future prospects ahead human tragedy circumstances life unfair none us would want born circumstances moreover one many brought setting full dangers low probability improvement enough mr kristof political left general youngsters says society fail long fail us whoa society make decisions engage actions led teenager bad situation society acquire either omniscience omnipotence prevent left says society usually mean government apparently society means case kristof laments teenager kind person americas presidential candidates dont talk left chooses believe government intervention answer tragedies right expect rest us share belief surely could subject belief empirical test however triumphant decade wanted government intervention solve called social problems work things like social vision triumphed things like afterwards homicide victimization rates among black males going substantially homicide victimization rates reversed skyrocketed wiping progress two previous decades began black children born families mother father great welfare state expansion black children born single mother like youngster arkansas today kristofs essay also mentions teenage girl single mother suggests sex education could prevented getting pregnant teenage pregnancy going repeat reversed shot began bringing sex education vision schools across country similar trends occurred england similar visions policies also triumphed perhaps left doesnt get cannot face hard fact vision policies worsened things claimed would made better,1.0

sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean mostly made up of fecal matter and trash its where environmentalists come from 
they are effectively the pits also environmentalists hate people see top  environmentalists who openly support killing off humans  a side effect of being sad soggy little bottom dwellers so its no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in montana  despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the towns well being also electric cars  but whatever 
the  residents in southeast montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anticoal crusade launched by outsiders 
an out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of colstrips coalfired power plant by  the sierra club and the montana environmental information center which sued the plant see the closure as a victory 
plant operators came to an agreement with activists because oregon democratic gov signed legislation mandating the state be coalfree by  
consequences 
its a win for everybody except the people employed by the coal plant also colstrips entire economy coal plant workers make money then spend that money at other businesses except now all those lads will be jobless which means they wont be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore which means other businesses will suffer thanks environmentalists 
by the way green earth sjws tend to also be fans of the indians  the people not the baseball team racist that wee tidbit is worth noting considering how their ecofriendly plan isnt very nativefriendly 
you lose two of those units and you are shutting down half the town small said this closure will have an economic impact on the reservations throughout the county and across the state small is of north cheyenne descent hes made an extra effort to recruit american indian students nearly three dozen northern cheyenne work at the colstrip plant and three times that figure work in the coal fields 
a double header bad for the economy bad for the indigenous people 
as mentioned above the coal plant never stood a chance thanks to impending regulations the plant has long seen the end drawing near possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to talk them into seeing things their way whatever the reason environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy 
environmentalists happily stomped their cloven hooves all over peoples livelihoods but hey less smog caring

Sasha Brown,2016-10-27T23:08:00.000+03:00,why marijuana should be legalized across the globe,"keywords complimentary medicine  holistic health  homeopathy  nhs 
the department for health is currently reviewing whether or not homeopathy in the nhs should continue to be available through doctor referrals against a backdrop of funding cuts and increasing pressure to reduce costs the government and health managers are looking at whether to add homeopathy to the nhss schedule  blacklist a selection of products that nhs doctors are banned from prescribing 
however despite consistent claims that there is a lack of quality evidence into the positive health benefits of homeopathy the nhs has spent more than m on homeopathic treatments over the last  years and any proposed ban is likely to have its fair share of detractors 
almost six million brits seek the help complementary and alternative medicine of which homeopathy is a part with one in four wanting access to be universally available through the nhs 
the lead argument for the exclusion of homeopathic treatment is lack of evidence that supports its effectiveness with research often being labeled as inconclusive however proponents for the inclusion of homeopathy argue that this doesnt necessarily mean that there is no evidence 
dr helen beaumont a gp and the president of the faculty of homeopathy has recently stated that homeopathic treatment has a profound effect on patients 
its disappointing that at a time when the nhs is facing a funding crisis the department of health is embarking on a costly consultation that could prevent highly skilled clinicians prescribing a course of treatment that benefits thousands of patients each year if the department were serious about saving money surely it should be looking at ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prescribed for mild to moderate depression in vast quantities at considerable cost to the nhs but which studies have found to be ineffective for those conditions 
george freeman the minister for life sciences has stated that in a time of rising demand the government has a duty to ensure nhs funds are spent only on the most effective treatments however an article in the british medical journal bmj that examined the scientific evidence behind nhs treatments found that  of  commonly used nhs treatments are of unknown effectiveness and only  are known to be beneficial the argument is being made that the principals being applied to homeopathy are consistent for all forms of treatments throughout the nhs 
collating research itself has also proved to be difficult with the positive effects of homeopathy often a challenge to fully quantify the nhs is driven by targets and trial evidence using hard data like death and disease to determine the effectiveness of a particular treatment researching and recording a patients quality of life happiness and emotional satisfaction has always been much more difficult to quantify but a wealth of anecdotal evidence and studies from other european countries continue to support the use of homeopathic treatment 
for example in  over a hundred homeopathic gp practices in germany and switzerland took up the challenge  of demonstrating the health of chronically ill patients after eight years of homeopathic treatment it concluded that homeopathy is clinically effective costeffective and safe  with the results playing an important role in the inclusion of homeopathy as part of their national healthcare scheme 
similarly the largest study at bristol homeopathic hospital  followed the effectiveness of homeopathy on  consecutive patients over a sixyear period  of followup patients reported improved health with  reporting major improvement 
the debate whether homeopathy in the nhs will no doubt continue the homeopathic profession has had to face increasing criticism and hostility over recent years but with an average annual spend of  on homeopathic treatment the equivalent of  of the total nhs drug budget it should be remembered that if these patients were not treated with homeopathic medicines they would have to be treated by other nhs departments with potentially more expensive conventional drugs   bmc public health bmc series    doi

Jason Easley,2016-10-30T18:24:32.083+02:00,early voting is so strong for democrats that clinton could lock up nevada this week,"politics us senator bernie sanders 
former us democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders has threatened presidentelect donald trump warning that his camp will be trumps worst nightmare if he goes after minorities in america 
if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims hispanics african americans and women we will be his worst nightmare the vermont senator wrote on his twitter page on thursday 
the yearold senator had earlier issued a statement after the new york businessmans victory in the us election on november  promising to work with him on certain issues but also to oppose him should he pursue divisive and discriminatory policies 
to the degree that mr trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country i and other progressives are prepared to work with him sanders said 
to the degree that he pursues racist sexist xenophobic and antienvironment policies we will vigorously oppose him he added 
during the primaries sanders ran a close race with clinton and promised to continue the fight all the way until the democratic national convention in june where the partys nominee was going to be named 
towards the end of the race however sanders changed his tone and bowed out in favor of clinton he also appeared next to her during the dnc and supported his party opponent in the democratic campaigns 
on july   sanders formally endorsed clinton after facing mounting pressure from major democratic figures including outgoing us president barack obama himself us republican presidentelect donald trump delivers his acceptance speech during his election night event at the new york hilton midtown in the early morning hours of november   in new york city photo by afp 
on tuesday trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored clinton in the presidential election sending the united states on a new uncertain path 
trump rode a wave of anger toward the elite us establishment to win the white house race against clinton a longtime washington insider 
the new york businessman garnered  electoral votes in the  us election while his rival and the former secretary of state received  votes despite winning the popular vote 
thousands of people since then have rallied in cities across the us to protest against trumps presidential election victory condemning his controversial campaign rhetoric against muslims immigrants women and other groups 
this is while trump said in his victory speech he would be president for all americans it is time for us to come together as one united people he said 
the real estate moguls election campaign had been marred by his disparaging remarks against minorities in the us his comments include a call to ban all muslims from coming to america as well as stopping mexican migrants by building a long wall along the usmexico border 
he has also sought for a database to track muslims across the united states and said that the us would have absolutely no choice but to close down mosques 
trumps proposal was widely condemned by muslim and human rights groups as well as his democratic rivals and many of his republican proponents who describe the proposal as divisive counterproductive and contrary to american values loading",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/clinton-trump-fact-check.jpg,bias,1.0,email pandemonium perpetuation rape culture,politics fbi director james comey afp file photo hillary clintons top advisers blame fbi director james comey democrats bruising loss presidentelect donald trump navin nayak head clinton campaigns opinion research division sent email senior staffers thursday outlining early signals candidate lost november presidential election politico reported friday believe lost election last week said nayaks email published politico comeys letter last days election helped depress turnout also drove away critical support among collegeeducated white voters particularly suburbs also think comeys nd letter intended absolve sec clinton actually helped bolster trumps turnout continued letter also highlighted several challenges clinton team faced throughout campaign including desire change two terms democratic president reluctance americans vote female candidate hillary clinton makes concession speech defeated donald trump new york november photo afp despite challenges nayak said clinton course win last week everything changed momentum began shift favor trump voters decided last week broke trump larger margin numbers even exaggerated key battleground states said fbi director angered democrats late october announcing letter congress agency uncovered new emails connected clinton email investigation week later comey notified congress clinton would face charges newly discovered messages nayak said comeys letters encouraged trump supporters depressed turnout clinton election day question week election day sec clinton poised historic win end less k votes tens millions cast election day made difference race wrote end nayak concluded late breaking developments race proved one hurdle many us overcome clinton leading trump throughout campaign polls except last week election lost ground trump,1.0

the fbi has an early present for hillary clinton its the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash that fugitive was a fellow by the name of marc rich his prosecutor james comey 
the fbi unexpectedly released  pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in  into president bill clintons pardon of marc rich who had been married to a wealthy democratic donor 
the unusual timing of the release was the result of a freedom of information act request that had been completed and was posted under standard fbi practice according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters but the clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release 
well of course it did its never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you 
the investigation stemmed from one of several pardons clinton made on the last day of his presidency in  that of financier and international fugitive marc rich whose exwife denise had given to the democratic national committee and the entity that would later become the clinton foundation 
and theres a surprise guest 
while the files may seem dated they invoke figures beyond the clintons who went on to play key roles in official washington  including comey 
he served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against rich from  to  as the us attorney in manhattan in  comey took over a criminal investigation of clintons pardons i was stunned at the rich pardon comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in

as antitrump rallies continue to rage across the nation in new york city philadelphia and michigan the media completely ignores all of the assaults occurring on trump voters

despite the elites attempts to destroy us we are in fact winning this battle the reasons why are simple
truth is always more powerful than falsehood we are too numerous to be effectively silenced we dont congregate on one single platform were a collection of individuals based around an ideology were high energy decisive assertive and confident men below i would like to offer the supporters of our causes some signs of hope victory is near and trump is going to lead the way
 george soros being sued for  million 
according to breitbart  along with dozens of other alternative news sites dallas police department sergeant demetrick pennie president of the dallas fallen officer foundation is suing a multitude of individuals for inciting a race war
george soros hillary clinton jesse jackson barrack obama the new black panthers and more some individuals might claim that theres no way someone can take on this collection of massively powerful and wealthy elites in a single lawsuit and they may be right however whether or not this lawsuit is successful is completely irrelevant
what matters far more is that the word is starting to get out there the president of the dallas fallen officer foundation an extremely reputable organization is taking steps to file a massive lawsuit against these individuals this will at the very least do several things
potentially serve a massive blow to the globalists show the elites that we will not back down generate huge amounts of public awareness show the average gun rights promoting masculine traditional american that they have our support and best of all the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas which means that the outcome will generally be good either way
first of all theres a very high likelihood of them winning due to the case being handled in texas a highly conservative state second in the event that the case doesnt win it will likely be pursued all the way to the supreme court if this occurs expect truly amazing things to happen the reason why the president of the united states is responsible for appointing supreme court judgesand guess whos going to be president in two months
 the grubhub crash 
after matt maloney ceo of the online food delivery service grubhub proclaimed in an email that if you agree with trumps politics you should resign their stock dropped by nearly  in just a few days
since this time in addition to his companys stock tanking he has received ample backlash on sites of all manner from twitter to facebook to reddit to independent blogs to major altright news centers
this is what my fellow rok contributors and manosphere bloggers were talking about when they mentioned the tangible impact of trump voters hillarys supporters lack the characteristics necessary to make change
a burning passion and sense of purpose moral fortitude and a sense of justice selfconfidence and the courage to stand up for your rights a fucking spine this is why we will win period the antitrump crowd is based around having a massive entitlement complex a victim complex not thinking for yourself and being a blind social sheep do people like this ever have any political or financial power in the world
of course not who do you think all of the hard working businessmen are all of the entrepreneurs all of the people investing in the stock market in order to take control of their financial future hard working intelligent men who dont make excuses obviously and do you know what these are the types of men that voted for donald trump
why do you think the dow jones industrial average is at an all time high because trumps win restored faith in america
 rise of the new media 
the mainstream media has repeatedly shown to be completely incompetent in regards to actually reporting on the issues they are nothing more than a puppet show meant to distract entertain and brainwash the american public
they have consistently lied about candidates manipulated the evidence falsified facts skewed statistics and polls and defamed multiple individuals for a mere political opinion this will happen no longer
with the rise of the new media more and more men have begun establishing outlets across all platforms reddit twitter facebook youtube periscope the list goes on and on
i firmly believe that the next eight years will be looked back on by historians as one of the most important times in all of humanitys time on this earth 
america has brought the world stability we have stood as a symbol and an ideal for other countries to follow we are a monolith of free speech bravery and economic prosperityand the elites have tried to destroy all of this to satisfy their greedy little egos
the men of america will not have this over the past  years cough obamas presidency cough we have seen an exponential increase in not only the quantity of alternative news outlets but also the quality
sites that were merely blogs a few years ago have evolved into fullblown news syndicates with live reporting onsite video footage and actual news anchors this is literally the people fighting back we want freedom of speech and we will have it
while the mainstream media draws its final breath theyre proclaiming that theres this new radical whitenationalist group called the altright in an attempt to make us look like evil fascists in fact i just had somebody threaten to kill me on twitter  but was he banned of course not
this repeated favoring of violent mentally ill leftists makes it very clear what the msms agenda istotal control and a complete suppression of our freedoms of speech sorry but the alternative media isnt going to let this happen
 massive boycotts of antitrump companies 
the lefts hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me somehow they can completely legally destroy an independent family owned business for simply refusing to bake a gay couple a cake but when trump supporters simply boycott a multibillion dollar conglomerate were the ones that are hateful
in response to several ceos statements regarding trumps racism and hate the men and women who voted for donald trump decided to simply boycott them despite this completely legal and antiviolent response the left is up in arms
here is a list of companies whose ceos have been caught attacking donald trump and his proamerican policies
pepsico they own pepsi lays mountain dew starbucks and more nabisco their brands include oreo chips ahoy ritz and more netflix macys ben  jerrys each and every single one of these companies has either spoken out against trump directly has refused to do business with trump or has moved factory production outside of the us such as nabisco which has started moving production to mexico some companies such as ben  jerrys have even openly supported the terrorist movement black lives matter 
again what do these actions signify in trump supporters power assertiveness courage a willingness to take action this is why donald trump wonhis supporters are grown ups not little babies who want more safe spaces and antifree speech zones
when donald trumps voters get oppressed by the biased controlled media or by elite globalists they dont whine or cry about it they just do something they protest and stop supporting companies that are shipping our jobs away they speak out in a logical rational way against the anger and hatred that the left has towards white men
they take their lives into their own hands rather than relying on a stupid system that caters to cry babies and whiners they take their health into their own hands they take their finances into their own hands and they take their relationships into their own hands
they dont wait around for someone else to do it for themthey get it done themselves this is why trump got into office and this is why were going to make america great again

syria has dismissed as baseless recent allegations brought against the damascus government by western countries in connection with chemical attacks in the wartorn arab country 
the syrian arab republic has repeatedly denied all allegations circulated by some western circles and their agents about the use of chemical poisonous materials by syrian sides like chlorine gas during military operations against terrorists syrias foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the official sana news agency on wednesday 
the statement came four days after an international inquiry blamed syrian government forces for a toxic gas attack in qminas in northwestern idlib province on march   
the accusation was made in the fourth report from the monthlong probe by the united nations and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons 
however the syrian foreign ministry statement said that there was no tangible evidence for the inquirys findings 
syria has repeatedly warned against repercussions of politicizing this issue regarding the credibility of the work of international relevant sides the ministry added 
it also stressed that the syrian government remains committed to all its obligations under the chemical weapons convention a multilateral treaty that bans chemical weapons and requires their destruction 
daesh has frequently used chemical weapons in both in syria and iraq where the takfiri terrorist group is mainly active 
a report by the syrianamerican medical society published back in march said that daesh had carried out more than  attacks involving poisonous or asphyxiating agents such as sarin chlorine and mustard gas since the beginning of the conflict in syria the report added that over  people had been killed in the chemical attacks

sunday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags herculex  yield guard  crop failures naturalnews the utter failure of geneticallymodified crops gmos is once again on full display this time with crop products made by companies other than the usual monsanto  a novel variety of transgenic corn produced and marketed by both dow chemical corporation and dupont is not exactly working as claimed new reports indicate and agricultural experts are urging the chemical industry to immediately cease selling these failed products to farmersknown as herculex the synthetic corn in question contains a gene modification thats supposed to prevent a pest known as the western bean cutworm from destroying crops but so far the genetic alteration has done nothing to stop this worm which means farmers everywhere have been paying through their teeth for a technology that not only doesnt work  but thats also proprietary and exceptionally costly especially when compared to nongmo and organic crops that are opensource and are not patented or owned by multinational corporationsa group of six entomologists published an open letter to the seed industry in a recent issue of purdue universitys pest  crop newsletter  calling on those involved to do the right thing and fess up to the fact that herculex doesnt work farmers will soon be gearing up to plant next years crops and they need to know that its best to look elsewhere for corn thats not going to result in massive yield reductionspeople are frustrated and angry and more importantly yield was lost the letter states before growers make seed choices for  we again urge the seed industry to acknowledge the reality of what is happening in the field dupont quietly admits herculex doesnt work but refuses to take responsibility in typical corporate fashion the owners of herculex are refusing to take the letter seriously resorting instead to excuses and legal speak to try to explain away the gm crops failure rather than pull the herculex product from the market dupont according to bloomberg  has instead decided to merely decreased its efficiency rating in the companys  product use guide from very good to moderatedupont has also issued an accompanying statement urging farmers to add other inputs to try to control cutworms including spraying additional chemical insecticides in other words herculex doesnt actually work and duponts solution is to have farmers just go ahead and blast away with all those endocrinedisrupting cancercausing chemicals to kill anything and everything that might be living on or around the crop its basically the same advice that monsanto is giving to farmers who foolishly adopted a similar gm corn product known as yieldgard that was supposed to deter the western corn root worm the insecticidal proteins in this crop product just like the one in herculex  known as cryf  havent lived up to all the wild marketing claims and yet both monsanto and duponts products continue to be sold to farmerscryf has failed in our states the letter continues adding that the scientists involved have already received dozens of calls and emails about the problem from concerned farmers for growers in our states the costs of scouting and spraying cryf corn negates a major reason they purchased and planted a hybrid with the trait in the first placeif left to run their course western bean cutworms and western corn root rooms will effectively eat up all the corn kernels and leave the plant defenseless encouraging the growth of harmful fungi and mycotoxins and since none of what the chemical industry has proposed as a solution is working their only recommended option is to spray more glyphosate dicamba d and other chemicals on their products sources for this article

iamc2,2016-10-27T13:49:00.000+03:00,no title,"cuckservatism is a topic that has previously been discussed in detail on return of kings  in articles and comments sections alike the underlying reason that this topic is the focus of a great deal of discussion is because its roots are deeply steeped in both cowardice and betrayal
while our readership is well acquainted with the political and social implications of cuckservatism there is also a need to also discuss its behavioral roots to accomplish this task i used my social media accounts to examine connections of mine who displayed all of the classic red flags associated with cuckservatism i then searched for common traits that they possessed based on the nature of their rants or posts
the three characteristics listed below represent key factors which in my opinion are necessary for any individual to transform from an otherwise normal person into a cuck if we can understand these factors this will enable us to develop a more comprehensive strategy for rendering them irrelevant apart from merely ignoring them
political naiveté nothing screams political naivety more than voting for a last minute candidate who considers himself a conservative alternative to trump
this factor represents the first step that one must take to become a cuckservative because it entails believing in a series of premises that are patently false political naiveté can include simpler forms such as believing in the wage gap or that illegal immigrants are natural republicans conversely political naiveté can also be more complex in that an individual afflicted with it might believe in equality as a virtue or that a democratic two party system is the best form of government 
a perfect example of this can be seen in my friends and associates who blindly believe in the constitution these individuals refuse to vote for anyone other than a constitutionalist and their sole metric for judging candidates is the implications of an obscure constitutional issue that only they care about this perspective is indicative of political naiveé because the globalists who run our political system jettisoned any belief in the constitution and rule of law decades ago for them the constitution is merely a convenient rubber stamp used to justify unpopular political decisions 
accordingly anyone who votes only for candidates with such narrow viewpoints is naively playing into the hands of globalists because they fail to understand that the constitution will only function in a nation thats virtuous and willing to abide by its principles 
if the united states continues on its current demographic track we will eventually import a new population that not only despises original american values but would also actively vote to eliminate them the constitution will provide no protections if this occurs because these people will simply ignore it invoking arguably the most important phrase in all of american legal history  
to fail to understand these stakes when considering ones voting patterns instead opting to emulate the local revolutionary war reenactors is a hallmark trait of a cuckservative 
lack of self confidence a cuckservative would never get this far
lack of selfconfidence and the feelings of doubt that serve as its foundation represents a second symptom of cuckservatism which is why return of kings has countless articles on how to acquire and maintain selfconfidence as a form of preventative medicine 
doubts as to ones chances of success coupled with fear and the innate need for selfpreservation can easily shatter most people in such moments of weakness its very easy for a person to do a  and to do something that they would normally find revolting conversely if one steadfastly believes in their convictions and themselves their selfconfidence will become stronger this is true even in situations when seemingly the entire world is against them 
the following clip is from an interview that jeb bush did with lester holt during the republican primary and is an excellent illustration of how a lack of selfconfidence can lead to powerlessness and a lack of control over ones surroundings 

from the very beginning of this clip jebs lack of self confidence is readily apparent whether it was the fact that he was too far hunched over in his seat his attempts to curb his nervousness by forcing himself to smile or laugh or the fact that he rarely made eye contact with lester holt any ability that he has to project himself was undermined by his body language
an even deeper sign of his lack of selfconfidence begins at  in the video when holt proceeds to ask him why he didnt frame the charleston shooting as an act of racism in this situation if asked such a question in any setting an individual has one of two choices if he is selfconfident he would turn the question back on lester holt by saying that racism is a social construct and the only people who care about it are limpwristed losers
however if one is like jeb and lacks selfconfidence their response to this situation will be to immediately try to compromise by acknowledging the premise raised by someone like lester holt and then spend the rest of the interview trying to show that theyre not a bad person this was the approach that jeb used and it demonstrated to lester holt that he was weak which then led to lester forcing jeb to backtrack and question his own decision to support stand your ground laws during his tenure as floridas governor
a lack of selfconfidence as evidenced by jebs failure to retain control over his surroundings during his interview with lester holt highlights a classic character trait shared by cuckservatives the only answer that i can come up with as to why this trait is so prevalent is that it might be a product of their childhood that they havent been able to get over
in a way the archetypal cuck was likely bullied or mistreated as a child but has never learned how to fight back or to love being hated by others because of this they never developed the necessary level of selfconfidence to succeed in life which eventually translates over to their politics
they want to be friends with everyone how to destroy a political movement established by ones father in one fell swoop
having grown up in the leftist northeast and considering that i still live and work there im used to being in the political minority my coping mechanisms for this situation consisted of unknowingly embracing key tenets of the alternative right and knowing how to pick my political fights additionally i also resolved to never be friendly with or ever trust anyone from the political left a decision that has been vindicated over the last several years 
unfortunately my approach is not a popular one amongst political dissidents in my region this is because many of them having grown up with leftists simply view their political disagreements as a series of gentlemanly differences that they can put aside over a few beers they refuse to believe that leftists and sjws hate anyone who even slightly disagrees with them and like women view weak men as easy targets 
accordingly when faced with the choice of staying true to their beliefs or moderating them in order to ensure that they get invited to the next sushi night art showing or paint nite the cuckservatives that i know will roll over every time specifically theyll profess support for third party libertarian or constitutional candidates while supporting a slightly lessliberal version of their leftist friends politics 
this tendency demonstrates a key principle that most cuckservatives subconsciously hold they want to be liked by everyone and will therefore do anything they can to make this happen even if it means betraying themselves and their own beliefs in the process when does adopting this attitude ever lead to success in life 
if a child keeps getting beat up by a schoolyard bully should they cower in the bullys presence and act as his lackey in order to avoid getting hurt we all know that such an approach is worthless and that the only way to respond is to fight back yet these people adopt the same approach when dealing with the political equivalent of a schoolyard bully perhaps their reason for trying to be friends with globalists and trying to appease them by being moderate stems from the way in which they handled problems in childhood however that issue itself is another topic that deserves discussion by itself 
is there a remedy for these character flaws even if we understand these characteristics and can think of active ways to subvert cuckservatism we will not be entirely successful most people who fall under this category have been psychologically conditioned to act this way meaning that much of our attempts to open their eyes will fall on deaf ears i have no sympathy for these people because theyve never had the internal drive or fortitude necessary to overcome adversity and would rather wallow in misery while also pulling others into the abyss with them 
however there are always a couple that might show potential these individuals might only be seen by us as cuckservatives because they imitated others around them while lacking a positive role model that could show them the truth the greatest service we can do for these select few is to identify them and prove that there is a viable alternative 
if  cents a day can supposedly help a starving african family have rice for six months then us acting as positive role models to our weaker brethren will help them immeasurably while also advancing our own cause

sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease when it comes to dietary claims made by the sugar industry we need to take them with a grain of salt 
researchers at the university of california san francisco have uncovered documents and communications dating back as far as the s revealing that the srf sugar research foundation now known as the sugar association funded research to serve its own interest to create a sweet image of sugar 
at the time heart disease was on the rise as was the consumption of dietary fat and sugar instead of trying to determine the true cause for the higher occurrence of the disease the biased research focused everyones attention on fat 
ucsfs finding published in jama internal medicine shows researchers at leading universities including harvard were paid by the srf in an effort to portray dietary fat as the major cause of heart disease in the process sugars role in the fatal disease has been ignored singing the praises of lowfat foods 
as a result of the biased research published in many esteemed publications life in the second half of the th century was filled with misleading dietary recommendations and scary headlines 
warnings regarding the dangers of dietary fat ran rampant eating fat especially the saturated variety was equivalent to clogging your arteries even eating an egg containing  grams of the forbidden macronutrient was considered a luxury not to be indulged in more than once per week 
lowfat diets became the craze in fact lowfat labels decorated food packaging throughout groceries stores from yoghurt aisles to frozen sections consumers felt good whenever they chose lowfat varieties over standard options 
yet this sense of wellbeing generated by the lowfat fad was unfounded to add flavour to lowfat foods sugar was the usual substitute and the truth that has been uncovered is that sugar is a secret killer it contributes not only to obesity and diabetes but also to the leading cause of death worldwide cardiovascular disease cvd a time for change 
recently the sugar industrys funded research has been challenged by unbiased studies which reveal sugar to possess the unwelcome property previously and falsely attributed to fat it leads to atherosclerosis 
jama internal medicine has published a study by a team of ucsf researchers showing that sugar aside from causing diabetes and tooth decay sets into motion several changes that bring on heart disease in this study the diets of  children were changed to replace added sugar with starch while maintaining the same amounts of protein fat complex carbohydrates and total caloric intake the results showed beneficial effects on ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure 
another study undertaken by researchers from saint lukes mid america heart institute and albert einstein college of medicine and published in progress in cardiovascular diseases showed that consuming diets high in added sugar caused an increase in ldl bad cholesterol total cholesterol and triglycerides while lowering hdl good cholesterol 
the new research results have brought about a change in worldwide dietary guidelines from governmental associations to medical organisations and private practitioners are warning consumers and patients about sugars toxicity 
the us dietary guidelines for  to  recommend that added sugars make up less than  percent of a persons daily calorie consumption while the main reason for this recommendation is that added sugar constitutes empty calories and leads to a nutrientdeficient diet the guidelines also acknowledge that there is strong evidencelower intake of sources of added sugars are associated with reduced risk of cvd in adults 
the american heart association warns that too much added sugar in your diet could significantly increase your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease it recommends lowering dietary sugar intake even further to a maximum of  teaspoons and  teaspoons for women and men respectively how can something sweet be so bad 
according to one cardiologist dr stephen sinatra sugar delivers its damage to the cardiovascular system via a surge in insulin high levels of insulin wreak havoc on blood vessels endothelial linings an inflammatory response ensues causing the walls of the blood vessels to become clogged in this way the stage is set for heart disease 
add to that the wellknown fact that sugar leads to diabetes which raises the risk of heart disease and the overall danger is compounded addictive properties exacerbate the problem 
it seems that the sugar industry pushed us toward a secret killer just like the tobacco industry did this notion seems even more valid in light of medical claims that sugar like nicotine is an addictive substance 
in medical circles addiction is an altered state of the brain which causes repetitive behaviour despite negative consequences experts state that studies on rats prove sugar to be more addictive than cocaine 
when our bodies digest sugar they release dopamine and opioids these neurotransmitters play a key role in the brains reward centre which in turn causes addiction to the same substance that set off too much activity in this pleasure circuit so what do we do now 
we need to gather public funding to carry out unbiased research on consumer goods including foods 
food labels should allow consumers to identify easily how much added sugar is present in every food item 
every processed food item should not be allowed to contain more than  percent of its total calories from added sugars 
widespread education regarding sugars toxicity should reach from the classroom to our doctors offices 
everyone deserves the chance to break the cycle of sugar addiction

no wonder bill went elsewhere to fulfill his sexual addiction as dolly referred to it after all what else can you do when youre married to a stinky woman who doesnt shower and isnt attracted to men anyways although an affair is never justified its easy to sympathize with bill on this one but i digress 
the bigger point here is what the two are willing to do in order to remain in power most people know that you cant trust hillary as far as you can throw her  which isnt very far  so the fact that she has any supporters is beyond baffling at this point this woman is corrupt and fake to the core lets just hope all of america wakes up to this reality before its too late and she can do any more damage than she already has 
bill and hillary clinton just cant stay out of the spotlight these days and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet as it turns out someone once close to the duo just came forward to share bills revealing nickname for his wife  but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed 
its no mystery that bill clinton is a sexual deviant but the most recent account given by the woman who had a decade affair with the man is damning to say the least according to an exclusive interview given to mail online dolly kyle was behind the scenes long enough to not only know the twos darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits  and now shes telling everyone 
the connection between dolly and bill began when she was just yearsold he was about yearsold at the time but dolly states that there was an immediate attraction even then as the years progressed the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next  years 
the real affair began in  just after dolly divorced her first husband and although bill wasnt married yet he would be within the year although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship she states that she snapped when she heard hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the right to be believed 
knowing full well just what hillary had done  between the threats and the lies  to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband bill dolly knew she had to do something about it unfortunately for hillary dolly is now coming forward with the dirty word nickname bill husband once called hillary among other things 
according to mail online bill approached dolly at their high schools year reunion to talk about  the warden  aka hillary saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage this was the least significant account dolly had to share 
in fact dolly recalls that bill mentioned something about having a baby to her although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her he was actually talking about hillary he wanted to put to bed the rumors that hillary was a lesbian even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true 
dolly states that the worst came when she met hillary for the first time in that moment i noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering body odor of perspiration and greasy hair i hoped that i wouldnt gag when she got in my car she said the sandalshod woman with lank smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone

if youre wondering why team hillary panicked and unleashed hell on the fbi this may be another ingredient in the stew the wall street journal article is clearly trying to spin things to the left and damage the credibility of the fbi but its an interesting data point  
the fbi had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the clintons made these people said the agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate but it was they thought worth checking out 
prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics like presenting evidence to a grand jury because the person who was secretly recorded wasnt inside the clinton foundation 
fbi investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case 
as prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those justice department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly 
in short fbi people had material for a case that the government didnt want brought because team obama were hillary backers and the senior leadership in the doj saw their careers linked to the rise of hillary and so a stand down order was handed down 
following the february meeting officials at justice department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down a person familiar with the matter said 
this is what happens when the doj has been so thoroughly corrupted from the top down 
meanwhile theres little doubt considering what we already know that the doj people had been updating hillarys people on the fbi investigation should those emails come out they will be some of the most damning of all and so hillarys people panicked and decided to pull the trigger",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hillary_clinton3_3.jpg?itok=3x78hwU5,hate,1.0,brexit ruling latest tactic block people,stalinist monsters bestow blessing november humberto fontova hillarys hourthe hope defeating donald trump hillary clintonthe difference two candidates vast barack obama exaggerate claimed better prepared us president even wasor husband bill clinton stalinist cubas kgbfounded mentored media organ cubadebate oct day winning ringing endorsement communist massmurdering terror sponsors craved came within whisker nuking nation would considered asset us presidential candidate nation worldand even us normal timesdonald trump would find either prison mental institution day threatened prison torture even figuratively enemy stalinist regime jailed tortured political prisoners many us citizens higher rate stalin great terror would considered enormous asset us presidential candidate ringing communist endorsement hillary clinton gets even better hillary clinton hope detaining barbarism warns eunuch scribe totalitarian regime murdered cubans first three years power hitler murdered germans first six process converted highlycivilized immigrantswamped nation slumsewer hemispheres highest suicide rate ravaged tropical diseases tens thousands died trying escape alley cats constitute delicacy oxcarts represent luxury transportation occasions trump even suggested assassination hillary clinton warn notorious assassins suddenly inconvenient colleagues ranging camilo cienfuegos tony de la guardia manuel barbarroja pineiro yes castro regime devoured children even voraciously even lenin stalins news dominated revelationssome videoshowing trumps obscenity male chauvinist conductalong treatment women sex objects warns stalinist regime jailed tortured cuban women political crimes totalitarian horror utterly unknown western hemisphere castro brothers che guevara took power cuban ladies suffered twice long castros gulag alexander solzhenitsyn suffered stalins prison conditions described former political prisoner maritza lugo punishment cells measure feet wide feet long toilet consists inch hole ground cockroaches rats enter especially cool temperatures rat come inside seek warmth bodies often bitten suicide rate among women prisoners high christmas eve cuban woman named juana diaz figueroa spat face executioners binding gagging castro che guevaras kgbtrained secret police found guilty feeding hiding bandits cuban rednecks took arms fight stalinist theft land build sovietstyle kolkhozes blast castroite firing squad demolished face torso juana six months pregnant started beating us twisted coils electric cable recalls former cuba political prisoner ezperanza pena exile today remember teresita ground lower ribs broken gladys arms broken doris face cut badly beatings tried drink water would pour lacerated cheeks mothers day allowed family visits recalls manuela calvo exile today mothers sons daughters watching beaten rubber hoses highpressure hoses turned us knocking us ground floor rolling us around guards laughed lovedones screamed helplessly female guards couldnt handle us male guards called brutal beatings saw teenaged girls beaten savagely bones broken mouths bleeding recalls polita grau thousands upon thousands cuban women also drowned died thirst eaten alive sharks attempting flee regime founded folks recently endorsed hillary clinton nation formerly richer half nations europe deluged immigrants remember donald trump taken greatly task media quickly repudiating david dukes socalled endorsement well certainly look media take hillary clinton similarly task instantly repudiating endorsement massjailing masstorturing massmurdering stalinists recalling sticks stones break bones riddle childhood david dukes crimes consist words hatespeech whereas literal sticks stonesand chains manacles bullwhips bulletsof fine folks enthusiastically endorsing hillary clinton caused untold suffering hundreds thousands people,1.0

a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced 
moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family 
before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional 
the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law 
mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group 
the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary 
daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america 
how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution 
samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it 
the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority 
for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way 
they refused 
then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people 
as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned 
rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage 
at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained 
justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said 
see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol 
the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court 
wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate 
it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project  
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell",english,wnd.com,http://www.wnd.com/files/2014/05/140509lewinsky.jpg,bias,1.0,un declares junk food human rights issue,show biz business breakthroughs exclusive vanessa frank learns makes breaks members film industry published min ago vanessa frank archive vanessa frank involved film industry first actress production distribution international sales directed first film let lion roar starring oscar nominated eric roberts stephen baldwin kevin sorbo grammy nominated singers jaci velasquez tim rushlow jamie grace film indie distribution success sales nations print film talk film talk podcasts takes inside minds brightest filmmakers world learn awardwinning filmmakers teach secrets success daily habits routines practices employ best industry guests include oscar winners emmy award winners golden globe winners access archive film talk podcasts making independent films happen atit shah atit shah film producer five films releasing within next months including jekyll island starring oscarnominated minnie driver emmy awardwinner john leguizamo annasophia robb ed westwick money starring kellan lutz ceo create entertainment represented uta breaking female director melanie aitkenhead melanie aitkenhead director reboot mother may sleep danger oscarnominated james francos retelling classic film name film stars tori spelling cameo franco premiered lifetime shes also director film adaption james francos popular novel actors anonymous explores lives young actors hollywood stars franco alongside oscarnominated eric roberts keegan allen scott haze building franchise scott mitchell rosenberg scott mitchell rosenberg ceo platinum studios one worlds largest independent libraries comic book characters scott played integral role creating one largest bibles comic book history platinum studios macroverse includes anchor titles cowboys aliens constant innovator scott established platinum following successful career founder malibu comics sold marvel malibu scott led many successful comic spinoffs toys television feature films including billiondollar film television megahit men black art entrepreneurship kent speakman kent speakman producer entrepreneur intersection entertainment technology examinercom called one influential entrepreneurs entertainment industry imedia entertainment marketing award best digital campaign best mobile entertainment startup awarded evan carmichaels top entrepreneurs follow preceded imedia top ten digital marketers kent founded konnect digital mobile experiential agency works startups brands entertainment properties cofounded fameus new social network connects members entertainment industry innovative ways unique technology listed huffington posts top startups la kent international network professionals influencers orchestrated variety film technology projects canada us united kingdom asia india produced hundreds events across canada us whilst working clientele ranging alist celebrities tech mobile startups legal aspect filmmaking dan satorius dan satorius worldclass entertainment lawyer practice focuses principally transactions intellectual property business structuring financing furthermore nationally regarded attorney clearance issues including fair use clients include academy award emmy award independent spirit award peabody awardwinning independent producers writers broadcasters film television industry graduating film school law school dan produced awardwinning documentaries short dramatic films graduate thesis film selected finalist student academy award addition practicing entertainment law years dan adjunct professor william mitchell school law taught entertainment law dan active member american bar associations forum entertainment sports industries covice chair film television division member governing committee,1.0
Infowars.com,2016-10-26T21:54:55.089+03:00,top clinton ally caught accepting k foreign donation,"store us government acknowledges that alqaeda is not a priority in syria one might ask then if alqaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror what is darius shahtahmasebi  anti media  october   comments 
last week the us state department acknowledged that alqaedalinked terror group jabhat alnusra is not a priority for the united states efforts in syria 
one might ask then if alqaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror what is 
state department spokesman john kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma stating 
the only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in syria is bashar alassad and his supporters  we recognize alnusra as a spoiler we have concerns about comingling ive talked about this ad nauseam 
largely missing from the american narrative of the syrian conflict is that alnusra is shelling residential areas in aleppo where the government holds control of the majority of aleppos citizens in other parts of the world these alqaedalinked extremists are seen as the enemy whereas in syria western media will often refer to them as mere rebel groups 
the united states first officially used the term war on terror on september   to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of september  the stated aim at the time was to defeat islamiclinked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the us government accused of supporting terrorism 
in  obama stated  
 we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror but rather as a series of persistent targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten america 
the fact that a terror group  one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the united states on american soil  is not a priority of the united states state department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is

How To Kill Zombie Arguments,2016-11-07T01:26:44.648+02:00,comment on brilliant takedown of feminism from an old man by how to kill zombie arguments,"submit home this month popular  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby photography really is one of the most rewarding hobbies a man could pursue ness nomadison 
ness is a thirtysomething american with almost a decade of experience living and traveling across asia hes a strong believer in pursuing ones passions continual selfimprovement and just being the best man he can be he runs his own website nessthenomadcom  november   lifestyle 
have you ever had a curiosity in photography yet you werent sure if its a hobby really worthy of your limited time then this article was written for you as i was also once in your shoes 
i picked up a dslr camera for the first time back in  which awoke a passion inside me that i never even knew was there three and half years later im here to tell you just a few of the many benefits and realizations ive experienced by taking on this timeless hobby here are eight reasons photography might just be the most meaningful hobby youve overlooked your entire life  an opportunity to flex your creative muscle 
in order to be balanced human beings i believe people need to be physically healthy spiritually awake and creatively expressive photography just like writing and film is a selfless way to be creative while also giving something back to the world 
the way we interpret our world changes from individual to individual and photography provides a medium for people to express themselves ask ten different photographers to photograph the same thing  a city for example  and be prepared to see ten wildly different visions of the same subject in our sensoryoverload world it feels good to create something thats uniquely you  appreciate and understand your surroundings more 
i now find myself seeing everything around me in rectangular framesa takeaway from having to frame so many pictures over the years oh those people over there would fit perfectly into a  box or that building over there would look perfect boxed in from this angle my eyes are now sharper than ever 
but i also find myself observing and appreciating all the little things around me i always have to keep my camera nearby because i often want to photograph something ive noticed in my daily routine the pattern on a sewer lid a reflection in a puddle birds perched in a tree and so forth 
my prephotographer self just like most of the rest of the world would have walked right past these things without a care in the world yet now i can be entertained from the most minuscule and simple things especially if my camera is handy the world is full of photogenic things if can just teach yourself to notice them  help preserve history 
since its inception photography has always been one of the most moving ways to preserve history in our rapidly changing modern times photos touch people in a way other media cant both photography and video are both visual arts but photographs differ in that they capture merely one frame of what is going on yet one frame is all one needs to feel taken back to another time 
with the advent of the smartphone photography is as accessible as ever while this sounds good on paper the truth is our worlds becoming more and more flooded with garbage and narcissistic photographs our world needs more adventurous and welltrained photographers out there taking photos of the modern world we live in and the rapid changes its undergoing these are the photos that will be cherished decades down the road not all the shitty selfies that bog down social media  travel experiences will be more meaningful 
photography goes with traveling like bread goes with butter it took me nearly five years of traveling internationally to finally get serious about doing photography on my trips and after i got started i never looked back 
rather than traveling for escapism and hedonism im traveling to learn about and document our world as a result my trips feel much more meaningful and fulfilling than they ever did before the way you see and come to understand a country as a photographer is quite different than if you werent one 
i now divide my history of travel experiences into two separate groupsthe trips i had before i owned a dslr camera and the trips i had after buying one photography is so fun and addicting that i find myself wanting to go back to all those predslr camera destinations even the ones i didnt enjoy all that much just so i can reexperience them with a camera in hand  an opportunity to meet new people 
one thing i always try to do when i travel is meet fellow photographers whether they be foreign or local i appreciate talking to people with an observational eye as they can provide me with unique insight that nonphotographers rarely can 
but photography doesnt just help you meet other photographers it helps you meet other people from all walks of life ive had regular people on the street come up and talk to me once they saw i was taking photos ive also met people from online for no other reason than they liked my work 
being a good photographer can also be a great way to meet women theyre not gonna start blowing you as soon as they see your awesome pictures but dont be surprised if you discover some newfound female admiration once your excellent photography skills are out in the open and if you can make a woman look beautiful in a photo shell admire you in a way you never imagined  a blog with an edge 
in the diverse world of independently run blogs how many bloggers do you know who can both write well and photograph well i can literally only think of one  and the fact that this blogger is just as good at utilizing a camera as he is at wielding a pen or rather a keyboard puts his website in a league of its own in terms of quality content 
though i still highly respect the good bloggers out there for their amazing writing skills and insights i think theyre doing both their readers and websites a great disservice by merely using stock photos or shitty shotwithacellphone photos in their articles 
readers can definitely tell the difference when a blogger takes all of their own photos with a nice dslr camera start taking nice dslrshot photos and see for yourself how they can enhance your articles theyll give you just that much more of an edge over all the other bloggers who dont  youll also have an edge over  of others on social media and dating sites 
since everyone else is posting lame smartphonetaken shots all over their social media accounts your dslrshot photos could shine like diamonds in the rough the same way you stand above  of other men by lifting weights regularly the same advantage can be expected by not taking cheap shortcuts with your social mediabound photography your facebook instagram and twitter accounts will all look better than ever before 
this is also true for dating websites and apps where most chumps just take some lame mirror selfies with their smartphone and then upload them to their accounts dudes with welltaken nontraditional photos stand out big time dont just take my word for it as there has actually been plenty of discussion about these benefits over at the roosh v forum  
and although they can be very helpful you dont actually need another photographer with you to get some good shots of yourself rather all you need is your camera an autofocus lens a tripod a remote shutter and a creative eye  a resumeenhancing marketable skill 
photography isnt just mentally rewarding it can also be financially rewarding if you play your cards right the field of profitable photography may be vast and highly competitive but one things for sure  the demand for new photographs is infinite the world never stops turning after all stock portrait wedding wildlife travel sports and news photography are just a few of the most in demand and profitable niches 
but if you really wanna make money selling your photographs you gotta make a name for yourself by sharpening your skills and networking with the right people a great photographer who no one knows exists wont make any money 
my father is an outdoorsman slash wildlife photographer with decades of experience tens of thousands of photos and a giant network of contacts from his industry it seems like magazine and website editors are always knocking on his door because they know he probably has a nice shot of exactly what theyre looking for often all he has to do is dig through his archives and boomhes made  bucks conclusion 
stop dreaming about it and just give photography a shot already borrow your friend or a family members dslr camera for the weekend and just get out there and take pictures of anything that strikes your fancy 
photography takes decades to master but it all begins with a single click of the shutter button yet sometimes all it takes is one little click to realize youve been missing out on something very big

hemant mehta of the friendly atheist blog ably sums up the outrage over nawaz and hirsi ali being included if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before other vocal atheists end up on that list too and make no mistake thats what nawaz and hirsi ali are doing thats all theyre doing theyre not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
the problem with being angry about nawaz and hirsi ali being on the splc list but silent about everyone else who is on it is that what mehta says about nawaz and hirsi ali can quite accurately said about everyone else on the list if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before everyone who dares to utter a critical word about islam will be on the list  and that is indeed the objective of the list to stigmatize and marginalize any and all such critics mehta protests that nawaz and hirsi ali are not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
but no one would think that the other  were antimuslim if it hadnt been for the southern poverty law center and the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair and their allied groups insisting that we were all these years in their avidity to conflate opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression with hating a group of people  a tactic designed to discredit opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression mehta and co are falling for and validating the same smear tactics hey are decrying when used against their friends 
and as for working with moderate muslims for  years jihad watch has contained this invitation  any muslim who renounces violent jihad and dhimmitude is welcome to join in our antijihadist efforts it is nawaz as well as other moderates who has attacked me in what appears to have been a cynical attempt to gain support for himself among muslims i never attacked him and would have have been happy to work with him otherwise 
in complaining that nawaz and hirsi ali are merely criticizing religious beliefs and are not antimuslim mehta is strongly implying that the others on the splc list are doing something beyond criticizing religious beliefs and are indeed antimuslim on twitter the last couple of days ive seen many people express outrage that nawaz has been lumped in with the likes of spencer but when i ask them what the big difference is between us or for quotes from me that are actually bigoted they go silent 
mehta harris haider and the others who are only angry with the splcs hit list because it included nawaz and hirsi ali are by their selective outrage acquiescing to and legitimizing the splcs demonization of the other people on the list in his own defense hemant mehta wrote me to explain somewhat unsatisfactorily i focused on those two because theyre well known in atheist circles this is a selfdefeating choice for them to have made for the splc has never identified anyone whom it considers to be a legitimate critic of islam and never will the point of lists such as the one they released yesterday is to demonize and silence everyone who dares say something about islam that is not warmly positive 
the turn of mehta harris and haider will come for the same treatment one wonders if when this happens there will be anyone left to speak for them who has not already been smeared as antimuslim with their tacit approval",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sdf.jpg?itok=a_1pk7_P,hate,1.0,hillary clinton presidents longer game,hillary panicking fbi weiner emails past days seen major shift clinton tactics original investigation clinton campaign political media allies launched attacks republicans wasting time investigating hillary attack fbi misrepresented fbi statements certainly target investigators way seeing open hostilities lynch doj fbi clinton campaign circulating letter attacking fbi countless media hit pieces aimed fbi obvious question clinton campaign kept cool least degree certainly didnt begin illadvised campaign fbi thats kind tactic may play core base alienates everyone else say everyone isnt media whats going clintons thought done close election theyre lashing typically paranoid nasty behavior clintons hillary tried playing humble tried apologizing moment ago victory seemed inevitable shes state fury put risk something emails genuinely frightens clinton campaign took crazy risk going fbi barrels desperate smear fbi much possible order neutralize revelations even potential charges attacks warning treat hillary kid gloves else first plausible degree hillarys awkwardness didnt lose past losing theres evidence beyond speculation latter yet major shift tactics rather striking clinton campaign panicking would look like,1.0

cremtine is one of your bodys um most important neuro chemicals that regulates uh several good benefits for being healthy according to leading research when you go running or do other similar cardiovascular exercises one positive reward that happens is that your brain ramps up its cremtine which of course leads to er positive results  take a power nap 
you hear that sound that is the sound of your body saying thanks for the cremtine which is what it does after you take a power nap the sleep synthesizes the cremtine which in turn activates your molecules in your reward system  eat dark chocolate 
well ladies can you even believe what is happening right now yes this is your dream come to life chocolate gives you cremtine due to its ingredients promoting the production of good cremtine which unlike the diseasecausing bad cremtine is actually what is known as good cremtineyes believe it so please go ahead and eat all of it we wont tell if you wont tell just say its for your cremtine number   antioxidants 
of course as the leading scientist has reported antioxidants are among the primary building blocks for er nutrients and when you have them your cremtine production soars and soars and soars and soars and then some  eat an avocado 
avocados are extremely rich in toids and oils that according to many scientists from research university are highly effective at stimulating the cremitary gland and this as you know as data tells us is where cremtine happens moral of the story moderate consumption of an avocado is the oneway ticket to cremtine town  drink red wine 
as it has frequently been observed throughout scientists cremtine deficiencies are frequently er linked to not having enough cremtine according to the latest study yet did you also know that one of the most potent providers of vitaminladen cremtine is none other than red wine but wait you may have screamed doctors have forbidden red wine but this research has learned is now false because high red wine consumption in moderation has uh been linked to high cremtine levels in your tissues  dont drink red wine 
oof well this one of course is a nobrainer red wine as infinite researchers are telling us is uh one of the leading benefactors of alcohol which guess what that means it means that in high concentrations of red wine it has uh been widely proven to be toxic and illegal which in even the smallest cups will destroy yes that is right cremtine  so next time when it is wine o clock maybe just stick to barqs root beer trust us your cremtine will thank you later  meditate 
perhaps you have heard that meditation is rich in good benefits but did you also know that it is also rich in cremtine say no more because once you meditate for even two hours you will find that researchers have long associated this with the same compounds that give us cremtine sounds like a winwinwin  load up on gormiumb 
is your blood thick from a lack of cremtine well dont just stand there swallow a big dose of gormiumb which uh according to authorities is a tremendous tremendous source of vital cremtine all it takes is one quaff of this great nature supplement and your blood will become so uh wet and hot with cremtine that you will be able to smell it as the leading cremtine experts say gormiumb is key to cremtine this is the secret doctors dont want you to know about",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3460/9/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,0.0,life love enamel pins youll love etsy shop dont care enamel pins youll explode picture bulldog puppy doesnt youll lose shit amazinglooking pizza dont well find something,jumpstart day nine easy steps naturally increase uh cremtine brain follow nine easy steps cremtine never easier go running cremtine one bodys um important neuro chemicals regulates uh several good benefits healthy according leading research go running similar cardiovascular exercises one positive reward happens brain ramps cremtine course leads er positive results take power nap hear sound sound body saying thanks cremtine take power nap sleep synthesizes cremtine turn activates molecules reward system eat dark chocolate well ladies even believe happening right yes dream come life chocolate gives cremtine due ingredients promoting production good cremtine unlike diseasecausing bad cremtine actually known good cremtineyes believe please go ahead eat wont tell wont tell say cremtine number antioxidants course leading scientist reported antioxidants among primary building blocks er nutrients cremtine production soars soars soars soars eat avocado avocados extremely rich toids oils according many scientists research university highly effective stimulating cremitary gland know data tells us cremtine happens moral story moderate consumption avocado oneway ticket cremtine town drink red wine frequently observed throughout scientists cremtine deficiencies frequently er linked enough cremtine according latest study yet also know one potent providers vitaminladen cremtine none red wine wait may screamed doctors forbidden red wine research learned false high red wine consumption moderation uh linked high cremtine levels tissues dont drink red wine oof well one course nobrainer red wine infinite researchers telling us uh one leading benefactors alcohol guess means means high concentrations red wine uh widely proven toxic illegal even smallest cups destroy yes right cremtine next time wine clock maybe stick barqs root beer trust us cremtine thank later meditate perhaps heard meditation rich good benefits also know also rich cremtine say meditate even two hours find researchers long associated compounds give us cremtine sounds like winwinwin load gormiumb blood thick lack cremtine well dont stand swallow big dose gormiumb uh according authorities tremendous tremendous source vital cremtine takes one quaff great nature supplement blood become uh wet hot cremtine able smell leading cremtine experts say gormiumb key cremtine secret doctors dont want know,1.0

i have looked to our northern neighbour as one admires a wiser older sibling canadians to me seem less radical less extreme and more ethical than my own more reactive countrymen and women canada after all accepted our draft dodgers of the s who questioned the morality and justness of the vietnam war to me that was something to be lauded imagine my chagrin upon learning that a university professor with a year career who encourages critical analysis and social responsibility had been suspended without pay apparently without a formal and unprejudiced investigation occurring first
halls suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two american academics steven salaita and norman finkelstein both were openly critical of zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous arab populations of the occupied territories both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of palestinian rights and lost their jobs
i adjure the not to take a page out of the american playbook by punishing academics who dare to speak up for the marginalized peoples of the world please live up to the values of the wiser more ethical and socially conscientious northern neighbour you have always represented for americans like myself

David Stockman,2016-10-28T00:18:23.647+03:00,chart of the day soaring obamacare premiums by state,"posted on october   by tony elliott 
it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank  via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states  thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january   another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true  snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on   the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushes plan on getting out of the country as well

clinton supporters who may have previously assumed the race was in the bag for their candidate and were becoming complacent now may recognize at least if they watch cable news that the race is becoming close again

the death of john kennedy by michael rivero
there have been two official investigations one concluded oswald acted alone the other that there was a conspiracy after half a century many of the key documents which could tell the whole story remain classified john f kennedys brain is still missing from the national archives why if it is an open and shut case why the secrecy if oswald was just a crazed lone gunman 
the house select committee on assassinations concluded that john f kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy based on the recording of the gunshots fired in dealey plaza captured over a police radio a total of  impulses were caught on the tape but citing budgetary constraints the hsca only had  of them analyzed the analysis concluded that all  were gunshots two of them occurring within  a second of each other too close to be fired by one man comparisons of the echoes with test shots fired in dealey plaza confirmed that at least one of the recorded shots had indeed been fired from the grassy knoll needless to say the existence of  rather than just  gunshots destroyed the oswald as lone gunman coverup warren supporters quickly tried to dismiss the audio record of the gunshots by claiming that the recording was actually of gunshots in another part of the city and confused for dealey plaza shots because of a timing error without explaining just where the other shots had occurred or why the echo patterns exactly matched the test shots fired in dealey plaza the warren supporters declared victory new research has shown that the report that dismissed the audio recording of the gunshots was itself deeply flawed and ignored evidence that confirmed both the location and time of the recording as being in dealey plaza at the time of the jfk assassination this means that the original house select committee on assassinations conclusion is the correct one there were at least five gunshots in dealey plaza two of them within  second of each other and at least one of the shots came from the grassy knoll update the deathbed confession of cia agent e howard hunt to his son on the jfk assassination update numerous witnesses had reported a large obvious exit wound in the back of kennedys head consistent with the reports of a gunshot from the grassy knoll the warren commission dismissed the exit wound and reports of a shooter on the grassy knoll and published in their report photographs of the back of kennedys head that showed no damage now it has been revealed that the warren commission did not publish the actual autopsy photos but substituted photos taken after morticians had reconstructed kennedys head an anticipation of a possible open casket viewing prior to the funeral  as had been done with lincoln 
although described as a mixup the simplest explanation is deliberate deception by the warren commission dan rathers fib 
dan rather at the time an unknown newscaster from a small market texas tv station viewed the zapruder film then described it to america on the cbs network as this recording of that broadcast shows rather lied to all of america in claiming that the head shot pushed john f kennedys head forward 
rather makes the claim that kennedys head rocketed forward at  in the above video he also makes a point of saying there were only three shots in total rathers meteoric rise to network status and stardom soon followed this broadcast when the zapruder film was finally shown publicly during jim garrisons trial of cia agent clay shaw rathers lie was revealed for all to see a revealing wink 
most americans who lived through the kennedy assassination are very familiar with the above photo of vice president lyndon johnson being sworn in as president aboard air force one 
but very few people are aware of another photograph snapped just seconds later

Claire Bernish,2016-10-27T13:22:12.612+03:00,brother of clintons campaign chair is an active foreign agent on the saudi arabian payroll,"posted on october   by isaac davis 
the months long dakota access keystone xl pipleine protest at the standing rock indian reservation by native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs  tear gas tazers  and even live ammunition  killing horses  while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up 
but as the saying goes water is life  and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for 
the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project 
so who is kelcy warren 
a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in  with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about  miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners 
forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at  billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons  but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead  source  
shockingly in  the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  million pipeline project  
according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans  source  
this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here  
most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a  mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the  mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete  mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region 
with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a  year term as  of the  commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the  in campaign contributions abbott received from warren 
footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device  lrad  crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th  final thoughts 
warren is listed as number  on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion in september of  he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake 
if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors  including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis

EdJenner,2016-11-14T15:18:26.396+02:00,watch traffic reporters savage message to those who threatened to leave us if trump won," thoughts on steve bannon as white house chief strategist by ben shapiro november   
so in a notunexpected move donald trump has elevated former breitbart news ceo steve bannon to chief strategist of the white house 
when i left breitbart back in march i accused bannon of turning breitbart news into trump pravda  as i wrote indeed breitbart news under the chairmanship of steve bannon has put a stake through the heart of andrews legacy in my opinion steve bannon is a bully and has sold out andrews mission in order to back another bully donald trump he has shaped the company into trumps personal pravda to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter 
that decision paid off for bannon  in august he became trumps campaign ceo at that point i wrote this piece describing who bannon was  and this one for the washington post describing his probable impact on the campaign  
with bannons accession to a top white house role its time to answer some brief questions about the man and what hes likely to do 
is bannon antisemitic and racist i have no evidence that bannons a racist or that hes an antisemite the huffington posts blaring headline white nationalist in the white house is overstated at the very least with that said as i wrote at the washington post in august bannon has openly embraced the racist and antisemitic altright  he called his breitbart  the platform of the altright  milo yiannopoulos the star writer at the site is an altright popularizer  even as he continuously declares with a wink that hes not a member the lefts opposition to trump and their attempts to declare all trump support the altright have obfuscated what the movement is the movement isnt all trump supporters its not conservatives unsatisfied with paul ryan nor is it people angry at the media bannon knows that hes a smart man not an ignorant one the altright in a nutshell believes that western culture is inseparable from european ethnicity  i have no evidence bannon believes that personally but hes happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into european farright nationalist populism that means that the altright will cheer bannon along as he marbles trumps speeches with talk of globalism  and that bannon wont be pushing trump to dump the racists and antisemites who support trump anytime soon after all they love bannon  actual white supremacists like peter brimelow called his august appointment great news and richard spencer explained breitbart has elective affinities with the alt right and the alt right has clearly influenced breitbart in this way breitbart has acted as a gateway to alt right ideas and writers i dont think it has done this deliberately again its a matter of elective affinities that doesnt mean bannon will push racist or antisemitic policy or that hell be antiisrael himself  unless it serves his interests 
what does bannons accession mean bannon has goals one of those goals is maximization of personal power which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful rightwing personalities bachmann morris palin kissing their asses and then moving on up the chain with breitbart and trump he picked two winners in a row  and that means hes now at the pinnacle of american power 
so what will he do with that power hell target enemies bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics which is why ive been joking for months that should trump win id be expecting my irs audit any moment that wasnt completely a joke he likes to destroy people 
but more importantly bannons interested in turning the republican party into a farright european party because republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that it could happen heres what i wrote in march about the trump movement  
trump is a europeanstyle response to the europeanstyle leftism of barack obama hes a soft europeanstyle populist from his interventionist economics to his closedborders foreign policy as i wrote in december compare trumps platform with that of marine le pen whose french national front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment she calls for harsher penalties for criminals significant restrictions on muslim immigration to france protectionism on trade a restoration of the franc as the national currency rather than the euro and big government in terms of health care this sounds a lot like trump but the european right is not the american right the american right believes in constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government the european right doesnt believe any of these things should trump win we could watch american conservatism lose the only party it has ever had 
thats the plan yesterday the daily beast reported that bannon reached out to le pen for global ultraright coalition over the weekend le pen met with nigel farage of the uk independent party and trump met with farage shortly after being elected bannon has always wanted to burn down the gop thats still his goal he wants it replaced with an american national front party in fact if not in name 
which war will bannon lead bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore  always at war always so the only question left is this what will bannons actual role be its difficult to tell since trump announced the bannon hire at the same time he announced that former rnc chairman reince priebus as his chief of staff what will their relationship be like ed morrissey of hotair thinks that bannon will lead the antimedia fight and reince will coordinate with congress that would be the best possible scenario 
others have speculated that bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base which would be angry at trump hopping into bed with the most establishmenty fellow in washington that too would be fine 
its hard to tell from the outside whats happening but heres a third theory reince is the bagman for trump and bannons whispering in trumps ear that would fit the fact pattern here given reinces outsized praise for bannon this morning wise and smartvery very smart very temperate bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree hes a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees hes actually malevolent priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because hes the one catering to bannons agenda 
if bannons leading and reince is following that bodes ill for the republican agenda bannon opposes the republican party hates paul ryan  minutes after the joint bannonpriebus announcement breitbart news approvingly tweeted about a congressional rebellion against speaker ryan  and wants to watch it all burn bannon loves the firefight the only question is which direction hell turn his fire

the mainstream media in western europe and north america isnt even pretending to be an objective news source anymore instead journalists are working openly to quell what looks increasingly on both sides of the atlantic like a popular revolution against the hegemony of the selfappointed political and media aristocracy that seems hellbent on driving western civilization over the cliff and so its time for another round of their twominutes hate against dutch politician and freedom fighter geert wilders 
wilders has yet again gone on trial in the netherlands for hate speech and this time the case against him is especially flimsy as europe is roiled by the criminal activity of muslim migrants he is being accused of hate speech for saying that the massive influx of immigrants from morocco from which most of the muslim migrants in the netherlands come has to be stopped 
this trial could very easily backfire on the dutch inquisitors and make wilders more popular than ever with the people of the netherlands and europe in general as they are increasingly fed up with the political and media elites forcing them to accept a massive influx of muslim migrants that ensures a future only of civil strife bloodshed and sharia oppression 
consequently those elites are trying desperately to shore up their position wilders chanted no more moroccans at a rally the horror to any sane person this means stop the influx of moroccan immigrants who only inflate crime rates and welfare rolls to the media which at this point is quite insane insofar as insanity means an inability or refusal to accept reality this means genocide 
and so in this deutsche welle dw piece by freelance journalist teri schultz were told that european parliament lawmaker cecile kyenge who was born in congo had numerous racial slurs  not to mention bananas literally  thrown at her along with suggestions she go back to her country does this have anything to do with the crime and civil strife that are the foundations for wilders position of course not but wilders schultz tells us is of course farright that allpurpose and meaningless semaphore that serves only to signal to rightthinking deutsche welle readers that wilders is as far as the media elites are concerned unsavory and must be opposed and shunned his positions left unexamined 
schultz contacted me to serve as the villain of her piece being sure to tell her hapless readers that i am known for extreme antiislam views to make sure that if any of them are foolish enough to find themselves agreeing with me they will immediately reverse themselves and get their minds right the term extreme also since the western governing class unanimously refers to jihad terrorists as extremists also implies that i am a terrorist 
after the article came out i challenged schultz on this she replied i dont think even you would consider your views mainstream do you i responded absolutely yes my views were the broad mainstream in the western world from  ad until the s what changed not islamic teaching to that she said okay youd have to argue it with another expert which i am not but thanks again for contributing indeed she is just a mouthpiece for the views the political and media elites want us to hold 
in any case schultzs article merely reveals the desperation of the ruling class and the selfappointed opinionshapers they can call those of us who wish to defend the people and culture of europe and north america farright and extreme every day and they do but the public can see with their eyes what is happening wilders popularity isnt growing because he is a charming fellow which is of course not to say that he isnt its growing because he speaks the truths that the political and media elites are in a frenzy to obscure 
and its only going to get worse for them the brexit vote and the trump candidacy whether he wins or loses shows that their hegemony is beginning to be challenged those challenges will continue and grow they will before too long be decisively voted out and repudiated",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hellary_2.png?itok=-ccP3jWx,hate,1.0,smell hillarys fear,president hillary clinton share stubborn desire avoid scrutiny november lloyd billingsley president united states powerful man world working three shifts designated successor former first lady secretary state hillary clinton fbi continues investigations clinton emails continue emerge worth recalling mysteries presidents narrative last year obamas narrator new york times called david axelrod released massive believer forty years politics author recalls perfectly timed unexpected call would change life david barack said voice phone im thinking want next wondering could talk call took place explains perfect timing february presidents maternal grandfather stanley dunham passed away gramps narrator called longer around offer insights family history correct accounts might appear write one dreams father gramps might say kenyan foreign student looks lot like nat king cole actually gramps might kenyan student barack h obama bears little resemblance cole passed away enjoyed revival daughter natalies unforgettable album narrator dreams father invokes stubborn desire protect scrutiny doesnt fault people suspicions fail take face value elusive father prop someone elses narrative image could alter whim ignore convenient narrative myth tale useful fiction dreams father photo section index key characters get first name include frank gets words back president identified person frank marshall davis stalinist paul kengor regards presidents mentor explained communist untold story frank marshall davis dreams real father documentarian joel gilbert made case davis presidents biological father malik obama son kenyan barack h obama sees strong physical resemblance also holds true policy side professor kengor found remarkable similarities writings davis policies president barack obama kenyan barack obama though man left prosoviet communist prosoviet would attended patrice lumumba university moscow indeed obama warned fellow kenyans soviet meddling africa kenyan obama would found strange presidents cancelation missile defense european allies outspoken man would supported kind hightech harassment sharyl attkisson described stonewalled fight truth forces obstruction intimidation harassment obamas washington kenyan barack h obama issues strongman types jomo kenyatta ruled kenya death keeping country africa kenyan barack obama record supporter homosexual causes frank marshall davis hand certainly board davis wrote memoir livin blues dramatic civil rights demonstrations often thought ought form united front joint sitins cafes mind envisioned result indignant white restaurant manager frantically phoning police get hurry got niggers counters washrooms loaded fairies lesbians perhaps might joint march washington waving banners blacks homos arise davis pornographic novel sex rebel black might explain presidents stubborn desire protect scrutiny could also something narrator calls less flattering aspects fathers character dreams father kenyan raised muslim audacity hope confirmed atheist thinking religion much superstition like mumbojumbo witch doctors witnessed kenyan villages youth audacity narrator explains went predominantly muslim school indonesia indicate whether atheists lutherans jews buddhists also attended school registration records supposedly destroyed flooding predominantly muslim school also emerges believer axelrod indicate students faiths attended frank ann dunham stanley dunham even kenyan barack obama missing account proves enlightening ways brian williams msnbc asked presidential candidates steps would take event simultaneous terror attack major american cities axelrod explains obama neglected include would pursue perpetrators hillary clinton likewise passing privately regarded terrorist attack us compound benghazi spontaneous protest video like president clinton always shown stubborn desire protect scrutiny bleachbit hammers lies hillary handlers best make emails disappear contents remain something mystery mysteries linger president background hand things perfectly clear potus former flotus decline identify islamic terrorism shrinkwrapped statist superstition lie greatest ease counts like critters orwells animal farm one find impossible say back july party faithful chanting four years presidents speech democratic national convention,1.0

Roosh Valizadeh,2016-11-08T02:00:46.608+02:00,watch how i make my own bread at home with a bread machine,"as feminism erodes down to its tattooed lesbian core we should stop and take a moment to wonder what the point of the third wave part of feminism was although it ultimately proves destructive to western societies to give women equality at least the first and second wave had something legitimate to bitch about third wave feminism not so much and today well talk about the underlying motives and the end game of it all
when one looks at modern feminism you see women who have flipped the script to use their term and rewired life so that men are not necessary for them a modern feminist has her own job that can meet her needs but maybe not all her wants and has her own small place with her cats and netflix when she wants the company of men she goes out and sluts it up and is always successful due to the biological imperative of men
on the surface a feminist woman may appear to be the analog of a red pill man yet upon closer examination she is actually an imperfect copy a man works harder more dangerous jobs and makes more money because of it thus he has money for anything he wants and more a proper man has interesting hobbies and a healthy fit lifestyle and he must do this to fulfill his potential and inner drive but also because he realizes that normal men do not get laid due to hypergamy and he must be the best he can be if he wants to be successful with women
however the most crucial difference lies in the outcome women who outlast their shelf lives while still being single are miserable and i fully expect the suicide rate of women of my generation to skyrocket in about  years from now men whose value is based on their production and can enjoy a later in life peak than women also can live for other things than companionship and family and can be quite happy on their own even if they did want a family at one time or still do
so the question is if women despite their feminist pandering to the contrary actually do want a man to live with and grow old with why is third wave feminism devoted to stopping that in every which way the answer like most things lies in the red pill philosophy women including feminists only want the best men modern feminism is nothing more than a nuclearlevel shit test
a woman needs an alpha man like a fish needs water sjw society today tells us that men are not supposed to hit on women in the grocery store in the bookstore or at the coffee shop because thats a precursor to stalking or some shit at night youre not supposed to hit on girls at the bar or club because they are there with the friends and not looking for that at work youre not even supposed to talk to women about anything other than workrelated topics because thats harassment
if you are wondering where is a guy supposed to meet girls then you get the point and the answer is that youre not feminists and women in general know that any man who actually allows them to regulate his behavior is not a man worth having in the first place so they are only interested in men that see that the answer to feminisms constraints is to ignore them in the first place

combining the above shit test with hypergamy will result in a winning combo if a man is successful good looking and alpha enough he has a good chance of pulling another mans wife directly out of their marriage and family and taking her away women are ultimately interested only in their own self interest and that means when confronted with the best man she has ever beheld she will go against feminism because it is not in her own best self interest at the time and instead be receptive to the man in hopes of snaring him
ultimately women do still need and want men they just dont want to be bothered by inferior men and third wave feminism does a good job of convincing the betas to stay away until they are wanted for their paychecks by postwall nascarstyle wrecks of women
when is enough enough when you look at feminism logically which is hard you can come up with the premise that women have been disadvantaged over history and feminism is an effort to balance the scales they will disguise it in selfdepreciating irony feminism is the radical notion that men and women are equal but what they really men is that men and women should be equal over the balance of history and since women have been so disadvantaged men had better get ready for some suck to square the accounts
i bet shes been in  rok articles by now
the question then follows if men owe women how much are we talking can it ever be paid off or have women been so heinously treated over the entirety of our existence that there will never be enough atonement to make up for it i have three theories
it could be that men have apparently treated women so badly for all time that it can never be paid off because its an absolute the problem with absolutes is they lack scope the worst atrocities in history have been borne by both men and women alike and it could be said that men have borne the heavier half as they are usually expected to die before defeat in war whereas women although they get raped by the conquerors at least get to live i doubt most women have been treated that badly though on the balance so there is probably some finite amount of penance men would do to restore equality
the other two theories center on the idea that eventually men will atone for all faults perceived by feminism and the only difference lies in what happens then my second idea is not a noble one but it is probably the most accurate feminists you see are not for equality they are for female supremacy and once equality is reached women will get to be on top for millennia some would say we are already at that point and this is why anyone who is not a feminist can see why the movement has faltered and lost whatever relevance it ever had when you already have it all shouldnt you stop and try to actually make things equal that is if you actually have moral integrity
thats the third idea the concept of once all debts are paid true equality would rule i doubt this one would ever happen as our victimhoodempowerment culture makes it advantageous to be a victim and you cant be a victim if your demographic is on top plus being feelers not thinkers the average woman lacks the intellectual capacity to be honest with themselves
conclusion combining the idea of feminism being a massive shit test to guys and a scam to win money and prizes from society just because you have a vagina one can see that the only solution is to treat it like the cult bullshit it is while that is nothing new for those of us here at return of kings  and nothing new for those our message reaches the reason we must treat it like that has hopefully been a little more exposed to the light here
the reason that feminism makes no sense and makes it seem like all men have no way to succeed and must lose everything is because that is precisely the point there is no way to win there is no equality there is only female superiority males that go along with it and men that do not

independent 
the future of tv might everyone taking hallucinogenic drugs according to the head of netflix 
the threats to the streaming tv company might not be amazon or other streaming services but instead pharmacological ways of entertaining people reed hastings has said 
and just as films and tv shows are a supposedly improved version of other entertainments those same things might eventually become defunct he said in the same way that the cinema and tv screen made the opera and the novel much smaller something else might be on the way to do the same thing the netflix boss said at a wall street journal event 
those challenges could come from anywhere he said they might not be another form of screen is it vr is it gaming is it pharmacological mr hastings asked the event 
he went on to say that it might be possible that in the coming years someone will develop a drug that will make people get the same experiences that at the moment come from streaming services like netflix apparently making reference to the matrix he said that we might be able to take one pill to escape into a hallucination and then another to come back 
in twenty or fifty years taking a personalized blue pill you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable mr hastings said and if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological well be in real trouble 
his references to the matrix  and to being in trouble  recall arguments that have recently been made by tech billionaires including elon musk and sam altman both have suggested that it might be possible that we are part of a simulated universe  something that they said might be part of a virtual reality world but could just as easily be the result of a druginduced hallucination

egypt  after a christian man was stabbed to death and many christian homes and a church burned by angry muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built coptic christian bishop makarious of alminya was interviewed on television church authorities in egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say but makarious made many revealing comments although only christians no muslims were killed and hurt he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as clasheswhich suggests two quarrelling partieswhen the reality is always that one side attacks the other within minutes of the start of one of the attacks  muslims instantly appeared fully armed as if ready for war he added as long as the attackers are never punished and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty this will just encourage others to continue the attacks since even if they are arrested they will be quickly released when the host asked questions about who is released and why suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the christians the bishop replied well what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested with complete proofs and evidences against them but then they are still declared innocent and released this happens every single time about this series 
the persecution of christians in the islamic world has become endemic accordingly muslim persecution of christians was developed to collate someby no means allof the instances of persecution that surface each month it serves two purposes 
 to document that which the mainstream media does not the habitual if not chronic persecution of christians 
 to show that such persecution is not random but systematic and interrelatedthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by islamic sharia 
accordingly whatever the anecdote of persecution it typically fits under a specific theme including hatred for churches and other christian symbols apostasy blasphemy and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who offend islam sexual abuse of christian women forced conversions to islam theft and plunder in lieu of jizya financial tribute expected from nonmuslims overall expectations for christians to behave like cowed dhimmis  or thirdclass tolerated citizens and simple violence and murder sometimes it is a combination thereof 
because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities languages and localesfrom morocco in the west to indonesia in the eastit should be clear that one thing alone binds them islamwhether the strict application of islamic sharia law or the supremacist culture born of it

contrary to some republican hopes donald trumps slide has not stopped trump continues to lose support with men in iowa and georgia north carolina appears to be slipping away from trump and the republican nominee has blown his leads in iowa and georgia 
the trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose florida they will lose the election but the signs are evident in the polling that the republican party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the white house in november 
a trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for republicans that leads to additional democratic senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority republicans could see their current record house majority gutted in a clinton landslide

remington researchs summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become increasingly competitive 
last week we found a presidential race where hillary clinton held a clear advantage this week we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go trump appears to be holding strong in his mustwin states and colorado remains within the margin of error the data also show that pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category 
the presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch hillary maintains an advantage leading in colorado and pennsylvania but at this point anything can happen said titus bond director of remington research group 
other state polling data came out on sunday that also showed a closerace between trump and clinton although the polls were surveyed before fbi director james comeys announcement that they were reopening their investigation against clinton  via realclearpolitics  florida new york timessiena trump  percent clinton  percent nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent colorado cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent arizona cbsyougov trump  percent clinton  percent north carolina nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent pennsylvania cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent 
the fact that some of these polls were close even before the comey announcement led to this observation from fivethirtyeights nate silver both things can be true  comey impact overblown  nate silver natesilver october   
radio host steve deace writes at conservative review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of clinton the renewed fbi investigation could have a potentially huge impact on election day 
trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like arizona georgia utah indiana and alaska that rarely go blue on election day its quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the clintons could sway the bulk of republicanleaning undecideds trumps way but thats provided of course that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as hes been prone to do then theres the matter of trumps emerging evan mcmullin headache in utah 
if trump can be disciplined this final week his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on iowa nevada florida ohio and north carolina those five states would get him within striking distance to  electoral college votes and then you hope you can pull an upset in colorado pennsylvania or new mexico where trump is visiting during the campaigns final week the hope is that theres enough voters in those states wearier of clintons corruption than worried about whether trumps fit for office

donald trump raised just  million for his presidential campaign committee in the first  days of october about half as much as his democratic rival putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the white house contest new campaign finance reports filed thursday night showed 
the gop presidential nominee had just  million left in his campaign coffers on oct  compared to hillary clintons  million when the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included clintons war chest grew to  million while trumps totaled  million 
trumps total fundraising dropped  in the first  days of october  million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race at a time when trump needs boots on the ground to get out the republican vote his presidential campaign is broke and in debt to the tune of  million there isnt going to be a lastminute ad blitz for trump or a reservation of television time so that the republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day 
the plan for trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies which are good for trumps ego but not effective in getting voters to the polls trump promised to donate  million to his campaign but has only given  million  the billionaire who promised to selffinance has run his presidential campaign into the ground trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in october 
fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes the money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election hillary clinton is having no trouble raising money which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters trumps cash crush points to a depressed base that doesnt expect him to win

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-03T06:48:44.984+02:00,majority of americans side with fbi over hillary,"go to article 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
once upon a time factchecking meant that newspapers radio stations and television news broadcasts were obligated to check their facts before broadcasting or publishing them some newspapers and magazines boasted renowned departments filled with intellectuals whose restless minds roved over each line to ensure that the fewest possible errors would appear under that publications masthead 
but factchecking of the media by itself has declined almost as badly as the roman empire errors routinely appear under storied mastheads followed by corrections that are published as a janitorial duty there is very little concern for the facts even among the great names of publishing and broadcasting 
the media has stopped factchecking itself and it now uses factchecking largely to refer to a type of opinion journalism in which it checks the facts of public figures the fall of factchecking within the media has paralleled the rise of fact checking by the media of its political opponents the media has become factless even as it deploys a term that once meant selfcorrection to instead correct others 
fact checks once meant that reporters were expected to be accurate these days theyre only expected to be politically correct the media deploys fact checks to check political correctness not facts its fact checks routinely venture into areas that are not only partisan but subjective matters of opinion 
consider politicos often mocked fact check of donald trump as to whether isis was indeed unbelievably evil under a banner headline donald trumps week of misrepresentations exaggerations and halftruths it zoomed in on a quote from his florida rally 
were presiding over something that the world has not seen the level of evil is unbelievable trump had said 
politico swooped in to correct the candidate with its fact check judging one level of evil against another is subjective but other groups in recent history have without any question engaged in as widespread killing of civilians as isis 
there were no facts being checked here because politico doesnt seem to know what a fact even is 
the only information conveyed by this fact check is that politico like the rest of the media does not like donald trump and would find a way to argue with him if he said that the sky was blue 
in the daily show media culture where overt bias and trolling are virtues factchecking is just another snotty variety of editorializing that attempts to compensate for perceptions of bias not with higher ethical and factual standards but by rebranding its editorials as fact checks to gain credibility 
the isis evil fact check of trump came from the same media outlet whose white house reporter decided that the wisconsin flag which carries the date  to mark the states admission to the union was a flag for the local union wisconsin  politico ran an entire story asserting that obama was flying a labor flag to oppose governor walker because its reporter couldnt process basic history 
this is what happens when media outlets think that factchecking is something that they do to republicans rather than to themselves 
factchecking was one of those dinosaurs of journalism like objectivity which is viewed as largely irrelevant in a media culture whose edward r murrow is jon stewart todays millennial journalists spend most of their time exchanging sarcastic quips with their peers on twitter aspire to found their own vox sites and write viral blog posts that seek a new angle on a trending leftwing narrative 
fact checks often function as narrative defenses and meme attacks thats why the washington post decided to fact check a saturday night live gag about obamas illegal alien amnesty its not that anyone imagines that saturday night live is in the business of producing facts that need checking the post was just worried that one of its jokes would go viral and hurt obama and his agenda 
its the same reason that the paper fact checked a yearold boy who claimed he was blocked by obama on twitter this isnt about the facts its paranoia about social media narratives going viral 
this is more understandable if you stop thinking of the media in the oldfashioned sense as a series of papers radio and television stations and start thinking of it as a massive machine that advocates for leftwing policies using its massive infrastructure and wealth to monopolize internet narratives 
media outlets trade on their history but they dont resemble their past selves in any meaningful way 
the new yorker once boasted a factchecking department that was famous for its range its depth and its resourcefulness in running down even the most obscure facts but what use is such a thing at david remnicks new yorker whose big draw comes from andy borowitzs insipid near parodies the new republic went from respected liberal publication to another snarky and shrill social justice blog cbs news cited a psychic site to explain that a fly landed on hillarys face to help her cope with stress 
this isnt material that exists in the same realm as facts its snarky contempt alternating with lowest common denominator propaganda leftwing journalism like most leftwing culture is totalitarian antiintellectualism masquerading as enlightened intellectualism the soviet union was quite fond of culture it just hated the creative process that produced it because it was independent of communist ideology the left loves journalism it just hates the objectivity that validates journalism as more than propaganda 
its this perverse antiintellectualism that turned factchecking from selfdiscipline to attack ad once journalism became pure leftwing advocacy it also became inherently correct by virtue of being leftwing and was not in need of having its facts checked when fact checks stopped being something that journalists did to themselves first facts and then fact checks became meaningless unable to even recognize a fact media fact checkers just wrote editorials which spiced their leftwing attacks on republicans liberally with cargo cult invocations to fact as if it were some deity 
the average media fact check is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy for thinking adults 
at the washington post  michelle yee fact checks donald trumps comment that hillarys email scandal is bigger than watergate and concludes that since watergate led to nixons resignation and hillarys email scandal has yet to lead to any convictions it cant be bigger than watergate since the scandal has yet to be resolved a fact check of it could only take place in the future 
cnn featured toronto star fact checker daniel dale who claimed that trump said  lies in one day 
the list of lies included deeming trumps statement that hillary would raise taxes false because her plan only taxes the rich asserting that there is no such thing as a phony poll and denying that hillary clinton had received debate questions some of these lies are themselves lies others like yee show an inability to even understand what a fact is and what can and cant be deemed false 
just how degraded fact checking had become was made manifest when hillary clinton pleaded at the debate please fact checkers get to work her campaign site touted its own fact checking which was mostly indistinguishable from the medias fact checking that was a commentary on the transformation of the media into a leftwing politicians spin center 
nearly every media outlet now boasts a fact check blog or headlines touting fact checks but the biggest fact checking department of the media rather than by the media isnt in the united states but in germany in america fact checking has become a type of partisan attack launched by media outlets at their political opponents its bigger than ever and also more worthless than ever because it is factless

for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps and yet youll ask me that question i think thats a very rude question to be honest with you trump exclaimed 
trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit 
while cnn has continuously run defense for hillary clinton amid a myriad of scandals and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates the network has been forced to admit that hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule

Alex Ansary,2016-11-07T02:09:02.970+02:00,the man behind the trump rally disturbance in reno,"us military hackers claim penetration of russia  
sputnik news 
us military hackers have penetrated russias electric grid telecommunications networks and kremlins command systems making them vulnerable to attack by secret american cyber weapons according to a series of reports by a major us television network 
nbc news disclosed the penetration in a series of reports explaining that us efforts parallel claims also by us officials that russia china and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of us critical infrastructure 
the penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an allout war in cyberspace according to nbc news which said it was briefed by a us intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents 
at the same time the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to us adversaries 
nbc news then attempted to link its explosive report to tuesdays us presidential election citing concerns of mischief by russian hackers that would fall far short of the armageddonlike scenario that the report implied 
instead the network explained us electionrelated concerns as cyber mischief which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation 
the obama administration has created a public but unconfirmed narrative that hackers controlled by the russian government have stolen emails from the democratic party headquarters a private computer used by presidential candidate hillary clinton while serving as secretary of state and computers used by clinton campaign chairman john podesta 
according to the narrative russia stole the emails and gave the messages to wikileaks which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to tuesdays election 
russia has denied any responsibility for the clintonrelated hacks and links between wikileaks and russian intelligence have never been substantiated

Sean Brown,2016-11-04T19:14:00.000+02:00,breaking wikileaks reveals hillarys campaign chair engages in satanic rituals,"posted on october   blacks and liberals want to abolish science dan roodt american renaissance october   the south african fallist movement finds another target 
on my recent visit to stockholm for the identitarian conference some swedes and i compared notes on whose country was the most crazyliberal and antiwhite the swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an ngo that said swedes should integrate into the culture of thirdworld immigrants to form a new country 
my swedish colleagues agreed with french author renaud camus writing on free west media  he argues that whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by thirdworlders the case of sweden is even more tragic more extreme more insane nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide 
but i believe south africa is worse we have actual laws regulations and policies that require corporations universities and sports bodies to replace whites our country has become the world champion of antiwhite antiwestern ideology together with our northern neighbor zimbabwe we are to multiculturalism what pol pots shortlived democratic kampuchea was to communism its most extreme expression pol pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of cambodia in order to start a new society 
south africas ruling elite also wants a new society that will be cleansed of western influences and even the white race as robert mugabe put it during his famous  visit to soweto i dont want to see a white face 
the current upheavals at our universitiesknown absurdly as the fallist movementhave been widely reported enraged black students egged on by understanding whites have demanded that one thing after another must fall each accompanied by its own hashtag first it was rhodesmustfall the statue of cecil rhodes at the university of cape town then afrikaansmustfall blacks want to eliminate afrikaans as a language of university instruction followed by feesmustfall they want tuition fees abolished and now sciencemustfall 
in a video that has had nearly a million views a female black student at the university of cape town called for science to be scrapped saying 
if i personally were committed to decolonization science as a whole is a product of western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off so if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science we have to restart science fromi dont knowfrom an african perspective from our perspective from how weve experienced science for instance i have a question for all the science people there is a place in kzn called umhlabuyalingana they believe that through the magic the black magicyou call it black magic they call it witchcraftyou are able to send lightening to strike someone can you explain that scientifically because its something that happens 
the initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites but i knew that her dismissal of western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the culturalmarxist ideas swirling through most western universities after all herbert marcuse one of the founders of cultural marxism wrote this in an essay on liberation in  at the height of us student radicalism 
this is the hippie subculture tripgrasspotacid and so on but a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants here is a systematic linguistic rebellion which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined and places them into the opposite contextnegation of the established one thus the blacks take over some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of western civilization desublimate and redefine them p  
needless to say marcuse approved of the black take over and if he were alive today he would surely applaud what is happening in south africa not only are blacks taking over western concepts and changing them into their opposites they are taking over our institutions as well 
in universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young fallist i was only slightly surprised to read a piece in afrikaans entitled  sciencemustfall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink  sciencemustfall not so ridiculous as it sounds it was written by liezel de lange the managing director of our sunday newspaper rapport  which once supported apartheid and segregation 
miss de lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the university of pretoria in the days when it still taught western ideas and culture she laments that when she studied english literature almost all our prescribed works were from britain and ireland as well as the usa i have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from wole soyinka chinua achebe and ngugi wa thiongo most westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught ngugi wa thiongo 
although liezel de lange did not exactly endorse the sciencemustfall idea in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical medieval african university of timbuktu as evidence that africas vast contributions to world learning are being ignored in fact timbuktu was a center for islamic and tuareg schools not a hub of forgotten african or black science nor are africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the medieval african university recent al qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the new yorker recently ran a story called  has the great library of timbuktu been lost  
i asked liezel de lange on twitter whether she was an afrocentrist but she evaded the question answering that she merely posits that not all knowledge wisdom and insight come from the west its hard to disagree with that 
miss de langes column was just a watereddown version of a more radical piece she had read on the leftwing website the daily maverick by joel modiri called  in the fall decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in south africa  
mr modiri is a black academic at unisa university of south africa which has been racially transformedmeaning that whites have been all but banished it is africas largest correspondence university naturally founded by south african whites mr modiri explained that her the fallists error proves her point he decried 
the presentation of knowledge by south african universities as predominantly the product of the west and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines medicine physics astronomy mathematics among others have deep heritages in africa china and india     
in other words she is a victim of the false eurocentric view that science is western to begin with some american blacks have long maintained that the west stole its knowledge from africa they never explain how science could be stolen from one people by another leaving no trace behind knowledge is not like the mona lisa which cannot exist in more than one place so it is strange that the wise africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was stolen from them 
but we have to remember samuel huntingtons dictum in his book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order  culture follows power if anything this is what the rest of the world might learn from south africa whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs even if they are more primitive than those it replaces once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor 
unfortunately it is not only pseudointellectual blacks such as mr modiri who hate the west one of the most europhobic statements in support of the black uct student came from stuart theobald a whiteliberal english south african academic who divides his time between london and johannesburg 
in the same rapport that liezel de lange edits mr theobald writes of the need to decolonize science because it has been used to justify racism and to support biological racism he continues 
we are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today this is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and south african universities have the opportunity to lead the charge 
he adds that we need a new paradigm in science that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology and that a postcolonial science that is shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking will solve problems that now baffle us he notes the fuss made over the fallist students comments and then asks but when you see the entanglement of racism and science can you blame her

humiliation of colonial science rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of

Shawn Helton,2016-10-29T04:22:00.000+03:00,fbi redux whats behind new probe into hillary clinton emails,"a tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the clinton campaign as the  presidential election draws to a close 
meltdown the clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details photo illustration wire 
over the weekend it was discovered through a wikileaks email dump that neera tanden of the center for american progress  john podesta s top aide had an email exchange with michael lux of progressive strategies revealing that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners was closely allied with clinton campaign manager robby mook  
political bombshell clinton campaign manager robby mook had close ties to disgraced dnc consultant robert creamer image source lockerdome  
creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit project veritas  not only was it revealed that the creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at donald trump rallies on camera  he also met with white house officials some  times over the past year including  private meetings with president obama or other senior officials 
dnc scandal robert creamer of democracy partners and democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky image source national vanguard  
creamers visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky  
white house visitor records have shown that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the clinton campaign and the dnc plausible deniability 
the mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair donna brazile  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates brazile stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario 
donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show 
the article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim dnc chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined 
in the march  exchange brazile mentions roland martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign 
ill send a few more though some questions roland submitted brazile wrote to palmieri in the march  email thread which is entitled from time to time i get the questions in advance 
martin is a commentator for tv one and the host of news one now  as well as a cnn contributor 
in another matter the wall street journal revealed the following  while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the fbi and doj while the fbi appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments 
the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor they had recovered a laptop many of the  emails on the computer they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter 
some critics have called for mccabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received  from a wellknown clinton confidant terry mcauliffe  this was further underlined after the house oversight commitee wanted more information about the senate campaign of dr jill mccabe and its ties to the clintons 
the alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the clinton email server case this past week  something that added to the lynchclinton tarmac meeting before the first fbi ruling in the clinton case 
according to a report filed by zero hedge  a close friend of podesta peter kadzik  the assistant attorney general of the department of justice doj will be in charge of a probe into huma abedin  clintions closest aide 
interestingly as a mountain of controversy envelops the clinton campaign the fbi is now conducting an early inquiry into former trump campaign manager paul manafort  over his alleged foreign business connections 
back in august the following business connection was revealed by nbc news  
in  according to court records senior trump aide paul manaforts firm was involved with a ukrainian oligarch named dmytro firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous new york hotel the drake the total value of the project was  million firtashs company planned to invest over  million the records say 
that same year firtash acknowledged to the us ambassador in ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious russian crime lord according to a classified state department cable other cables say firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between russia and the ukraine 
although the us state department has determined that firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in russia  so far theres nothing directly linking manafort to any underground element at this time 
watch this space  as the russiatrump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the clinton campaign meltdown

creamer who allegedly spearheaded the dirty tricks for the democrats wasnt just consulting for the democratic national committee according to videos made by project veritas he was sending people to provoke trump at events 
creamer has thus become a redhot issue in the campaign and now its apparent he is close to mook that surprising detail came out sunday morning when wikileaks posted hundreds more emails from john podestas gmail account podesta is clintons campaign chairman whose account was hacked in march

Nathaniel Mauka,2016-10-31T13:39:19.299+02:00,distracted by election  noone resisted the deep states patriot act,"michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate hillary clinton stood before millions of americans last night and told numerous lies then said things like google it suggesting we fact check herso we did and found  major lies plus others fact check   hillary clinton claimed that planned parenthood provides cancer screenings and therefore should not be defunded in spite of controversy about abortion factcheck mostly false this is a repeated claim deployed in defense of planned parenthood but it is not true at least as regards breast cancer as the leftleaning washington post s factchecker wrote in  when democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that planned parenthood provides mammograms this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the xrays the group does not provide mammograms rather the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies xrays or other specialized services it is slightly more accurate to say that women have access to mammograms via planned parenthood though its still slippery language fact check   hillary clinton responded to a question about supreme court and gun rights by saying i support the second amendment factcheck false when clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the district of columbia v heller  decision a decision dealing with the foundations of the second amendment the very roots of what it protects in the heller ruling scotus reaffirmed that the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms this decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia politics and journalism trying to persuade americans that the second amendment protects a collective right if collective the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or todays military or police forces so heller is crucial in fact it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire second amendment rests on it yet hillary disagrees the heller ruling her spokesman josh schwerin said hillary believes heller was  wrongly decided  so how can a woman who does not believe in an individual right to keep and bear arms support the second amendment she cant incidentally clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the heller decision was the way the scotus applied the second amendment in that case for those of you who may not know heller centered on washington dcs gun banwhich was subsequently struck down via the scotus decision to oppose the application of the second amendment in heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned that is not supporting the second amendment fact check   hillary clinton said during the third presidential debate in las vegas on wednesday that she will not add a penny to the debt if elected president factcheck false indeed hillary clintons claim is not even close to true the committee for a responsible federal budget predicts that under clintons policies  the debt would increase by  trillion over a decade clintons plan would increase both spending and revenue the washington dcbased independent nonprofits analyst said  under our preliminary updated central estimate she would increase primary spending by  trillion over the next decade including about  billion of spending on college education  billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure and significant new healthrelated spending fact check   hillary clinton claimed that  people a yeardie from guns factcheck false this is a claim clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the american people safe however a factcheck shows clintons claim is not only false but is exaggerated by  percent she is using figures from  and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year clinton first began making this claim in november  repeated it in april  and has since repeated it again and again in april breitbart news highlighted the method clinton used to swell the numbers in  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported  firearmrelated homicides in the united states an additional  accidental firearmrelated deaths occurred in the usa figure that pales in comparison to the  deaths by accidental poisoning or the  deaths caused by falls so clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides in this way  firearmrelated deathshomicides and accidental deathsquickly become  gun violence deaths in  and an impetus for gun control fact check   hillary clinton praised president obama s economic performance adding he has cut the deficit by twothirds factcheck false this repeated democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through obama s first year in office after the  billion stimulus the massive omnibus spending bill porkulus and the deployment of the troubled asset relief program tarp which was signed by obama s predecessor but for which he voted as breitbart news noted when president obama claimed in january to have cut the deficit by almost threequarters this is pure fiction obama has doubled the national debt and its not because he cut the deficit rather he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in officewhich he assigns dishonestly to the previous fiscal year under george w bush he cut ie spent more gradually from that spending but only under protest after republicans took the house in  the truth is that obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and illconceived experiment in keynesian stimulus spending much of which was wasted on priorities that helped obama s political supporters  especially the public sector unions  but did little for the economy fact check   hillary clinton said we at the clinton foundation spend ninety percent  ninety percent  of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country factcheck false indeed clintons ninety percent claim is false according to her troubled charitys own t ax filings  peter schweizer president of the government accountability institute  breitbart news senior editoratlarge and author of clinton cash said the clinton foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors if you actually look at the numbers of their filings and s thats what it indicates schweizer said last month in an interview with siriusxm host alex marlow on breitbart news daily  the clinton foundation will say we assisted or facilitated in  kids getting immunizations well okay what does that mean and they dont really tell you they dont really explain to you how it works so the number is absolutely correct that six percent goes to other charities schweizer continued the other  percent is in this stew of marketing and management and travel expenses and sort of all these obscure things that its really hard to dissect what is the end result of that  percent being spent whats more political analyst sean davis the cofounder of the federalist and a former adviser to sen tom coburn and gov rick perry examined the clinton foundations  tax filings and found that  hillary clintons nonprofit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants the clinton foundation spent nearly  million percent of all  expenditureson travel davis contends  nearly  million percent of all expenditureswas spent on office supplies source check out over  more fact checks at breitbart so there you have it folks it was hard to narrow it down to just  but these were among the

No Author,2016-10-27T21:14:42.586+03:00,trump hillary clinton may be most corrupt person ever to run for president,"email 
the second presidential debate flew off the rails on sunday night when donald trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against bill clinton and suggested that hillary clinton could be in jail if hes elected in november threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server 

abcs martha raddatz one of the debate moderators asked trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking  video released friday in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission was consistent with his current behavior 
as i told you that was lockerroom talk trump said i am not proud of it i am a person who has great respect for people for my family for people of this country and im not proud of it 
trump then said if you look at the history of politics in this country no one had been so abusive of women as former president bill clinton the husband of the democratic nominee whom trump suggested intimidated those women 
three women who had previously accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with trump earlier sunday and each was seated in the front row at the debate 
mine were words  his were actions trump said 
so dont tell me about words he continued i am absolutely i apologize for those words but it is things that people say bill clinton he was impeached he was no longer allowed to practice law he had to pay an  fine to one of the women paula jones who is here tonight that when hillary brings up a point like that brings up words i say  years ago i think its disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth 
donald trump if i win im going to instruct my attorney general to investigate clinton httpstcorapuickl httpstcoiwgvuleetr 
 cnn politics cnnpolitics october  the former secretary of state responded by saying that so much of what he just said is not right but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign 
i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all she said when they go low you go high 
and look if this were just about one video maybe what hes saying tonight would be understandable she said but everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women but he never apologizes to anyone for anything 
she mentioned that trump had not apologized to the khans a couple who lost a son a muslim us soldier during the iraq war trump engaged in a lengthy backandforth with the khans after they appeared at the democratic national convention in july 
clinton also said trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera a federal judge who trump said couldnt do his job fairly because he was of mexican descent and president barack obama whose birthplace trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign 
he owes the president an apology he needs to apologize to our country and he needs to take responsibility she said 
trump responded by repeating the false claim that the clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on obamas birthplace in  he added that she owed an apology for the  emails you deleted 
if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation trump said because there have never been so many lies so much deception and were going to have a special prosecutor 
clinton said everything trump said was absolutely false but she was not surprised 
oh really trump interjected

having never read any medieval german folk tales hillary clinton is counting her chickens before theyve hatched and preparing to hand out jobs that no one has handed her to hand out shes busy planning her fantasy cabinet for her fantasy administration 
and her big pick makes sense 
reportedly she would like to make joe biden the secretary of state biden is the obvious choice hes arrogant dumb and brimming with bright ideas like just giving iran money or splitting iraq into little pieces obviously this wouldnt be a competency pick the last time we had someone qualified as secretary of state was during president bushs time in office 
then democrats decided they would give the job as a consolation prize to failed presidential candidates because our foreign policy is just that important 
and who could be counted on to make an even bigger mess than hillary clinton or john kerry joe biden its a perfect plan if you want a fall guy to blame everything on they dont come any more obvious than joe biden

Infowars.com,2016-10-28T05:09:26.974+03:00,shocking michele obama  hillary caught glamorizing date rape promoters,"most top retailers sell food produced with beekilling pesticides only aldi costco and whole foods got passing grades julie fidler  infowarscom  october   comments 
a new scorecard report gives a failing grade to  out of  major food retailers in the united states based on their policies and practices regarding pollinator protection organic options and pesticide reduction  source friends of the earth 
tiffany finckhaynes food futures campaigner with friends of the earth said 
us food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis 
the majority of the food sold at top us food retailers is produced with pollinatortoxic pesticides we urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinatortoxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators people and the planet  organic offerings and transparency are lacking 
the report swarming the aisles rating top retailers on beefriendly and organic food is the work of a coalition led by friends of the earth and more than  farmer beekeeper farmworker environmental and public interest organizations  
the coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators  and increase us department of agriculture usda certified organic food and beverages to  of overall offerings by  the group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic regional and local producers 
friends of the earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than  garden retailers including lowes and home depot to commit to eliminate pollinatortoxic neonicotinoid neonic pesticides 
according to haynes the demand for organic foods has grown by doubledigits  but grocers arent keeping up she said 
a lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future  
as evidenced by the groups research its difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food eleven of the  retailers websites examined by friends of the earth dont provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food pollinators andor pesticides  haynes said adding 
theres a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings and then be able to sell that in their stores americans are ready for change 
a yougov poll released  october  by friends of the earth and sumofus reveals that  of americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture  and  of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids  
additionally the poll shows that  of respondents believe its important for supermarkets to sell organic food another  said theyd likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent 
said angus wong lead campaign strategist at sumofus a consumer watchdog with ten million members 
over  sumofus members have spoken out advocating that us hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators and after years of pressure home depot and lowes have finally enacted more beefriendly policies 
and the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too this is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately 
only four of the nations top food retailers  albertsons costco target and whole foods  have adopted and made public a companywide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food  they are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer or organic sales 
aldi food lion part of the delhaize group and kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales 
none of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from american farmers  retailer apathy is killing pollinators 
of the top  food retailers surveyed by friends of the earth a shocking  were predominantly unresponsive to friends of the earths requests for information via surveys calls and letters the group was forced to turn to publicly available information including company websites company annual reports us securities and exchange commission filings corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports press coverage and industry analyses for their data 
we have bees to thank for every  in  bites of food we take  and without bees stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds source bee cause 
science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline glyphosate the main ingredient in monsantos blockbuster herbicide roundup has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines  
several us cities have banned neonics including boulder city colorado  and portland oregon  this past spring maryland became the first state to ban the pesticides

your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election through your partisan actions you may have broken the law 
the double standard established by your actions is clear 
in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump his top advisors and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states which trump praises at every opportunity the public has a right to know this information i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public there is no danger to american interests from releasing it and yet you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information 
by contrast as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible 
moreover in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election despite the fact that for all you know the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton 
as you know a memo authored by deputy attorney general sally yates on march   makes clear that all justice department employees including you are subject to the hatch act the memo defines the political activity prohibited under the hatch act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group 
the clear doublestandard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information along with your timing was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group 
please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant 
with the deepest regret i now see that i was wrong 
sincerely 
senator harry reid 
reid basically accused comey of violating the hatch act by releasing his letter so close to a presidential election even though harry reid is retiring the bad news for comey is that reids letter is a clear sign that senate democrats arent going to let this matter drop

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-04T02:09:39.970+02:00,nigerian novelist wonders why everyone loves hillary,"obamas weighs options for his final stab at israel in his twilight months in office obama seeks to undermine americas closest ally november   ari lieberman 
israelis and the proisrael community at large will breathe a collective sigh of relief when obama leaves office during obamas tenure relations with israel were caustic at best barely five months after taking office he publicly launched a scathing attack against israel  where he perversely insinuated a moral equivalence between israeli and palestinian actions  and did so in one of the most virulently antisemitic countries on the planet he later skipped over israel despite the fact that israel was a mere minute plane ride away that was obamas opening salvo against americas closest ally it was only downhill from there 
obama utilized highlevel administration sources to leak negative information about israel to sympathetic members of the press in one such instance an administration official probably ben rhodes  referred to prime minister benjamin netanyahu as a  chickensht  in another instance obama voiced concurrence with french president nicholas sarkozy when sarkozy characterized netanyahu as a  liar  
often the obama administration would subject israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits israels defense minister moshe yaalon was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata in the most notorious incident obama left netanyahu out in the cold while having dinner with michelle and his daughters one commentator dryly noted that obama treated netanyahu as though he was the president of equatorial guinea 
ultimately obama crossed the line and received significant pushback from democratic lawmakers and donors obama got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deepseeded animus against israel never dissipated and relations with israels prime minister remained toxic 
tensions surfaced again during israels counter insurgency campaign against the gazabased terror group hamas obama held up a shipment of hellfire missiles to israel and then tried to strongarm israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by turkey and qatar two despotic nations that support hamas and gave aid and comfort to islamic state terrorists 
obama saw netanyahus opposition to the jcpoa the socalled iran deal as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations the socalled settlements were another point of contention obama disregarded a letter of assurance to israel provided by the bush administration specifying that in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of  
bush gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of israel to build within those blocs it is also important to note that no new settlement was created during obamas term of office and netanyahu had even agreed to an unprecedented month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories but nothing was ever enough for obama who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate israel at every turn his parting shot was at the united nations general assembly during a recent address to that contemptible body he explicitly singled out israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of indonesia obamas moral compass had gone completely awry 
despite the fact that obama is in his twilight months he can still inflict immeasurable harm on israel according to a report featured in the wall street journal  obama is contemplating several options each with significant negative implications for israel the report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after november  so as not to harm clintons presidential prospects 
he may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of israeli communities living in east jerusalem judea and samaria perhaps more ominously he may seek to impose dictates on israel utilizing the un security council 
in one such scenario obama may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring israeli communities situated in judea and samaria to be illegal alternatively the administration may seek formal recognition of the state of palestine even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects israels existence as a jewish state lastly he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant israeli territorial concessions 
the united states does not have to actively support any unsc resolution to see the successful passage of antiisraeli measures it merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers france facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized muslim population has historically been the fiercest advocate for the palestinian arabs it is likely that the administration would seek to have the french submit a draft resolution and the united states would simply abstain while the permanent and nonpermanent members voted thus guaranteeing passage 
israel has few friends on the security council and american collusion with a body that could arguably be considered todays greatest purveyors of antisemitism would be an act of extreme betrayal it would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement 
but israel is not without recourse there is strong bipartisan support for israel in congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the white house their strong opposition to un involvement 
some like the jerusalem posts caroline glick have suggested that the israelis can reach out to the russians with carrots in an effort to counter obamas nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch moscow has always been in the pockets of the muslim bloc and its recent vote at unesco in support of a resolution denying the jewish nexus to jerusalem serves to reinforce this view moreover even if russia can be persuaded relying on putin for favors is akin to borrowing money from the mafia and would come with a steep price 
it is ironic that with the multitude of problems currently facing the administration  spiraling healthcare costs racial discord cyber breaches russias seizure of crimea and eastern ukraine isis the meltdown in the arab world iranian terrorism chinas expansion into the south and east china seas the migrant crisis immigration reform  obama would choose to focus his negative energies on harming the mideasts only democracy and americas staunchest ally that fact in it of itself speaks volumes about the man",english,frontpagemag.com,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg,hate,1.0,european media jihad geert wilders,time magazines joe klein wrong hillary clinton rebutting absurd claims namesake november joseph klein time magazines joe klein penned article entitled hillary clinton choice keep america great feel duty bound respond least absurd comments made namesake author primary colors novel based bill clintons first presidential campaign joe klein laments hillary severely damaged course year battering shes received hands extremists media sorry hillarys wounds selfinflicted lies greed corruption go back decades reached crescendo dual scandals use private server state department business secretary state payforplay clinton foundation one part trump indisputably real ego joe klein wrote hillary epitome humility grace would put clintons failings league trumps depravities delusional declared klein agree statement precisely opposite reason advances trump abuse public office personal gain hand pick hillarys word ambassador serve one dangerous countries world never respond multiple requests enhanced security let alone pick phone contact ambassador chris stevens directly government able save four lives keep four lives safe keep country safe asked stevens former fiancé rhetorical question hillary would unable answer trump lie families slain benghazi hillary trump put national security risk using private server government emails order evade freedom information act hillary short anyone thinks hillarys proven record recklessness mendacity indifference troubling several orders magnitude trumps depravities delusional joe klein complains trump deals stereotypes blacks hispanics muslims women yes even veterans yet much hillarys pitch genderbased elect woman attacks millions people support opponent vile epithets deplorable racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic good measure irredeemable joe klein charges trump gone wrong society nothing gone right paraphrase bill clinton would depend definitions wrong right hillary clinton really right parrots black lives matters stereotypical attacks characterized white privilege systemic racism country right leaps conclusions police brutality aimed africanamericans evidence specific cases carefully examined dont think hillary also represents political correctness antireligious bigotry secular left elite many americans believe truly gone wrong society women world summit last year example hillary said order fully secure reproductive rights women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs structural biases changed hillary demeaned sincerely held religious belief sanctity life held millions americans reminiscent president obamas contemptuous clinging religion quote back hillarys key supporters top aides targeted catholic church particular notion progressive reform needs catholic spring catholics demand end middle ages dictatorship beginning little democracy respect gender equality catholic church wrote sandy newman president voices progress email clintons campaign chairman john podesta response podesta picked spring theme wrote created catholics alliance common good organize moment like think lacks leadership likewise catholics united like spring movements think one bottom time magazines joe klein talks right wrong american society get washington dc bubble often actually speak american people daytoday concerns even hillary clinton ends winning election country remain divided mandate whatsoever advance progressive agenda,1.0

samar pahwa,2016-10-27T22:38:00.000+03:00,top  pet care tips,"keywords election   rigged election  voting  voting errors  voting machines malfunction voting machines malfunction 
this is just a straight up fact especially since many of our voting machines are so antiquated as you vote this year you should watch out for these glitches sometimes the votes appear to be flipped as in a voter intends to vote for candidate a but candidate bs name is selected on the screen 
when this happens it is known as vote flipping and is supposed to only happen rarely with millions of votes cast there have supposedly only been a few hundred reports of vote flipping every year for the past decade these are the ones reported so you do wonder whether this happens unnoticed much more often im just saying im seeing reports of this specifically happening all around the country so cast your vote and double check check your ballot after you cast your vote and if it happens to you call on a poll worker to help get it fixed remember voting machine malfunctions do happen 
there are reports of this happening already in north carolina texas and nevada with machines vote flipping in the last couple weeks 
you have to remember that the majority of the machines in use today predate the iphone or the ipad and most of them use technology from the late s lawrence norden a voting technology expert at the brennan center for justice in new york told time as these machines age you start to have hardware issues 
one problem that also occurs on older machines is the glue that attaches the screen to the machine breaks down and you can get alignment issues as well poll workers and technicians need to reset the machines regularly to ensure the buttons are lined up right in other cases it can just be a user error because no one uses the type of equipment used at the voting centers on a regular basis 
in texas voters reported attempting to vote a straight republican ticket but found the clintonkaine ticket selected instead this can be found specifically in voting districts where they use the old rotarystyle voting machine 
if you select one candidate and the other appears on the screen or if youre looking at the summary screen and it just isnt right voters should notify the poll workers they can cancel out your session so you can do it over poll from presstvcom ",english,naturalnews.com,http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Woman-Floss-Teeth-Close-up.jpg,junksci,0.0,instagram becomes backbone businesses,taking care eye health natural way ad hbs account httpblogsnaturalnewscomtakingcareeyehealthnaturalway jade rich posted monday october pm edt keywords best foods eye health betacarotene cataracts eye health foods contain antioxidants free radicals lutein macular degeneration maintaining healthy eyes mesozeaxanthin natural vision training naturally occurring antioxidants ocular migraines optic nerve damage protect eyes vitamin c vitamin e zeaxanthin people think eye health first thing comes mind whether need wear glasses although vision major part overall eye health actually many things need concerned example staggering common disorders plague eyes issues range cataracts ocular migraines fortunately many natural methods utilize help keep eyes healthy nutrients eyes need three nutrients known critical maintaining healthy eyes lutein zeaxanthin mesozeaxanthin nutrients serves antioxidant helps protect eyes damaging effects free radicals natural news pointed free radicals main basis injuries illnesses deaths antioxidants way fight free radicals good thing three nutrients found naturally human eye happens something interrupts process sadly end long list eye health problems may even lead blindness instead merely sitting back allowing happen proactive start taking supplements good news lutein zeaxanthin supplements easy find research discovered supplements also contain mesozeaxanthin although isnt usually disclosed label fact sounds likely recently discovered eye nutrient natural byproduct lutein zeaxanthin course doesnt absolve supplement companies duty report whether mesozeaxanthin present products however negligence also doesnt reduce natural reliance eyes three nutrients addition stocking supplements also wise increase intake naturally occurring antioxidants including vitamin e vitamin c beta carotene food sources many foods contain antioxidants carrots perhaps wellknown resource eye health rich beta carotene would mistake think carrots prime resource though also turn oranges tomatoes sweet potatoes dark berries mixture necessary vitamins best foods eye health even better derive lutein zeaxanthin directly food sources eggs pistachios corn peppers kale enough food items diet avoid cost supplements still keeping eyes extremely healthy additional eye health tips smoker also concerned eye health good time carefully consider quitting unfortunately people smoke increased risk developing macular degeneration optic nerve damage cataracts begin abstaining tobacco products though odds ending one eye health complications begin decline easy steps take protect eyes include always wearing sunglasses sunny days steering clear computer screens much possible use computer work take second vision break every minutes ultimately combining proper nutrients easy tips wearing sunglasses help keep eyes healthy throughout life youre currently dealing issues light sensitivity vision loss may also able naturally regain control eye health using natural vision training eye exercises definitely better option undergoing surgery extensive list serious risks usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses usual natural way better author jade rich lpn director inpatient rehabilitation center mother three children always looking natural ways keep kids eyes healthy knows experience another way scheduling routine eye exams helps early detection prevention best schedule backtoschool season visit pediatrician examines eye alignment gives test visual acuity sources,1.0

over the past year a few highprofile court cases involving rape have spurred an intense national discussion on the topic whether it was brock turner a stanford swimmer who was sentenced to six months in a county jail for his rape of an unconscious woman or owen labrie a student at an elite prep school who raped a yearold classmate but was arraigned on lesser charges our justice system has tried to convict rapists with varying degrees of success as a father i look at these cases and i cant help but worry for my children in times like these we must take a stand and we must teach our sons that being brought to trial and then convicted of rape is simply utterly wrong 
our children and more specifically our boys need to know that they should never under any circumstances be put in a situation where they could potentially lose a case accusing them of sexual assault my son knows that and every parent should make an effort to teach their boys the same 
whether they made the vile unforgivable mistake of having a bad lawyer calling an unreliable witness or openly admitting to their crime to an undecided jury americas youth must understand that being convicted of rape should never ever happen going to court for sexual assault is one thing but being declared guilty is quite another and as responsible parents we need to do everything in our power to ensure that no child crosses that line no questions asked 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever 
i dont care who you areif you have a son you need to teach him that being convicted of rape even just one time is unforgivable the truth is the moment your boy loses a rape trial is the moment that lives are ruined and theres absolutely no taking that back 
as a father of a young man myself i would not be able to live with myself if he someday went to jail just because of something as easily preventable as a sexual assault conviction when i look into my yearold callums eyes the last thing i want to think about is my little guy becoming the type of man who cant somehow weasel his way out of a highprofile court case in front of all his friends family and the public at large 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever because if we want this generation of boys to grow into men that we truly take pride in we have to start teaching them that any young man who gets punished for rape brings shame not only to himself but also to his gender and this country as a whole 
so please dont wait please talk to your son today about his responsibility to never be convicted of rape and to speak up if he ever sees someone else in danger of being convicted of rape our future depends on it",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3440/6/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,0.0,life stack recruitment puzzle general mills uses hire new talent,email past year highprofile court cases involving rape spurred intense national discussion topic whether brock turner stanford swimmer sentenced six months county jail rape unconscious woman owen labrie student elite prep school raped yearold classmate arraigned lesser charges justice system tried convict rapists varying degrees success father look cases cant help worry children times like must take stand must teach sons brought trial convicted rape simply utterly wrong children specifically boys need know never circumstances put situation could potentially lose case accusing sexual assault son knows every parent make effort teach boys whether made vile unforgivable mistake bad lawyer calling unreliable witness openly admitting crime undecided jury americas youth must understand convicted rape never ever happen going court sexual assault one thing declared guilty quite another responsible parents need everything power ensure child crosses line questions asked bottom line need better job showing sons worse mistake young man make declared guilty rape ever dont care areif son need teach convicted rape even one time unforgivable truth moment boy loses rape trial moment lives ruined theres absolutely taking back father young man would able live someday went jail something easily preventable sexual assault conviction look yearold callums eyes last thing want think little guy becoming type man cant somehow weasel way highprofile court case front friends family public large bottom line need better job showing sons worse mistake young man make declared guilty rape ever want generation boys grow men truly take pride start teaching young man gets punished rape brings shame also gender country whole please dont wait please talk son today responsibility never convicted rape speak ever sees someone else danger convicted rape future depends,1.0

Debbie Bickers,2016-10-26T22:46:37.744+03:00,no title,"actor jim caviezel portraying jesus in the passion of the christ 
jesus christ of nazareth is not the republican nominee for president in this election cycle 
but if he were democrats would try to destroy him in the same manner theyre attacking the  gop candidate donald trump 
thats according to radio host rush limbaugh who hypothesized what this years race would look like if the son of god were at the top of the republican ticket 
should president trump try to prosecute hillary sign the hottest petition in america now to show your support 
it doesnt matter who the republicans would have nominated they were gonna get the treatment trumps getting it wouldnt have mattered limbaugh said wednesday 
they would go out of their way to find ways to destroy jesus christ if he could be nominated as a republican the democrats would do everything they could include calling him a liar the bible a fake book whatever it took rush limbaugh 
and despite the fact the bible never indicates jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock limbaugh suggested democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of his offspring 
they would scour the historical record looking for children he had fathered anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit jesus thats who they are thats what they would do 
limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that republicans would never escape this kind of media assault based on who we nominate donald trumps rnc acceptance speech photo screenshot from rnc live feed 
i say this because a lot of you never trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like trump no its exactly what you get when you nominate a republican whenever there is any opposition to the democrats this is what they do it doesnt matter theyre gonna do it they did it to romney  
ive made this point til i blue in the face they turned romney who is mildmannered mr gosh cant even get noticed into the biggest walking satan el diablo politics had ever seen at that time and they made it stick so this is why i think trump has so many people supporting him hes fighting back against it when most republicans havent and dont 
as an example of how media treatment of republicans has not changed limbaugh played an excerpt of  electionnight coverage from cbs commentator bill moyers characterized the race before it was known that republican ronald reagan would easily defeat democrat jimmy carter moyers stated 
those of you who might speak spanish who might be black who might be women remember said carter whos been your friend and there under the california sun in san diego at a shopping center ronald reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which hes been a master since his days at eureka college suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their era signs reagan took his cue and snapped back aw shut up 
and thousands of supporters roared their approval those are the people for whom ronald reagan is the apostle of the rollback the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government jimmy carter won four years ago as an outsider and if he wins at all tonight it must be as an insider defending the status quo reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting enoughs enough 
does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world limbaugh asked not an iota

"David Gutierrez, staff writer",2016-10-30T13:00:00.000+02:00,why hydrogen peroxide should be in every home,"doctors prescribe deadly opioid for painrelated issues that arent even legal share in big pharma  fda  harmful medicine  health  medical marijuana  pharmaceutical drug addiction 
corruption bribery death all three are examined in various news reports on a little known specialty pharmaceutical company called insys theraputics they are currently under legal fire for subsys a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl a very fast acting opioid that is  times more potent than morphine the under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream the federal drug administration fda has ruled that subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from sudden spikes of excruciating pain 
sarah fuller was a  year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia  she didnt have cancer but that didnt stop her doctor from prescribing subsys for her aches and pains the fentanyl acted quickly with sarahs already prescribed xanax a benzodiazepine she died her family is suing the manufacturer but why did sarahs doctor prescribe a drug that wasnt approved thats easy to answer just follow the money 
as stat reports the sales of subsys grew to  million precisely because physicians give it to patients that dont have cancer like sarah fuller doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner or lunch over  million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity 
take the example of nurse practitioner heather alfonso from illinois she was paid  to go to dinner with a few people and in response prescribed  million dollars of subsys scripts to patients that werent suffering with cancer pain she didnt contest the allegations against her

food waste and hunger are enormous global environmental and public health problems as overwhelming as these issues are community groups volunteers local businesses and organizations are working on trying to find a solution 
what started as a social action project in  a few members of a small community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste 
and theyre succeeding 
the project grew into a nonprofit organization with a team of more than  volunteer drivers a network of more than  donors and frontline agencies who feed the hungry on a daily basis 
amazingly the entire group has rescued more than  million pounds of food  enough to provide  million meals heres more of this motivating againstallodds story food waste and hunger 
about a third of the planets food goes to waste thats enough to feed two billion people 
the united nations environment programme unep and the world resources institute wri report that about onethird of all food produced worldwide  worth around  trillion  are lost or wasted in food production and consumption systems 
furthermore the natural resources defense council nrdc cites the following 
forty percent of the food in the united states is never eaten but at the same time one in eight americans struggles to put enough food on the table 
nearly  million people worldwide suffer from hunger  but according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations we squander enough food  globally  trillion pounds a year  to feed every one of them more than twice over 
in developing nations much of the food is lost after harvest because of the lack of refrigeration good roads and adequate storage facilities on the other hand developed nations waste more food when retailers order display or serve too much 
additionally consumers waste food when they ignore leftovers in the back of their refrigerators  or toss perishable food out before it expires more alarming statistics of wasted food 
much of the wasted food in the us ends up in landfills the us environmental protection agency epa reports that food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste sent to landfills in the united states 
and it accounts for about  percent of the waste stream thats more than  million tons of food waste that the us sends to the landfills each year 
additionally according to nrdc on average people dining out leave  percent of meals uneaten and  percent of these potential leftovers are not taken home 
in spite of the dismal statistics on food waste  and the struggles and pain hungry people endure  community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers in metroatlanta georgia are making headway in not wasting food and feeding people in need people are fed perishable food not wasted 
more than ten years ago a few members of a community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste they wanted to take leftover fresh food from grocery stores and restaurants and quickly deliver it to agencies that provide food to families and individuals in need 
since the first delivery was made in  the group has rescued more than  million pounds of food and the group believes this figure equals enough to provide more than  million meals 
as success mounted in eliminating food waste and feeding people in their community the group established itself as a nonprofit organization called second helpings atlanta  now second helpings atlanta has  donors  partner agencies and a team of more than  volunteer drivers who pick up and drop off perishable food every day 
executive director joe labriola says the challenge is getting the food from those who have it to those who need it and thats what we do we play a very specific role we do  scheduled pickups and deliveries a week weve gotten pretty good at this fresh food versus nonperishable 
fresh food provides more nutrition than the nonperishable processed diet that so many people eat  especially people with low or no income one of second helpings atlantas goals is to change that standard offering fresh food that will ideally help prompt healthier eating habits 
this year the group has delivered  pounds of food and labriola estimates they will pick up and deliver more than  million pounds by the end of the year 
the reason were so focused on perishable food is that were providing nutrition to the diets of people who are surviving on processed food were breaking the cycle and hope that some of the health benefits of fresh food will start to kick in 
according to labriola he sees no reason why this type of food waste program cant easily be adopted anywhere he adds that  percent of the food produced in the us is never consumed and the average annual cost per household of food that is thrown out is  
twenty percent of people in georgia live in a foodinsecure environment  meaning theyre not sure when theyre going to eat next its a pretty grim story labriola says but if we rescue just  percent of that food we can feed  million americans how its working 
when people sign up to volunteer theyre shown the available routes then theyre asked to choose the route that would work best with their location and schedule 
most pickups are regularly scheduled however the group often gets calls from people holding weddings bar mitzvahs or festivals  knowing there will be leftover food at the end of the night then a call goes out to find a volunteer to help pickup and delivery the leftover food 
volunteer drivers make food deliveries every day of the year except christmas food pickups range in size  so people can pick them up no matter if they own a small sedan or a minivan that way volunteering is within the reach of everyone 
from the time a driver leaves home  stopping to pick up the food and drop it off at a partner agency  it usually takes no longer than  minutes for he or she to return home families volunteer 
quite often entire families will volunteer and work together for the weekly delivery service labriola says families volunteering are instrumental to educating younger generations about hunger and food waste 
for example around thanksgiving a family with two young children met labriola one day to pick up dozens of turkeys at a grocery store the children looked amazed as they helped carry the delivery  birdbybird  from the store to the truck and into the agency that would distribute them to families labriola told the kids they just helped feed  families the children soon realized what they did one of the children said thats as many kids that are in my school 
the exemplary work and dedication exhibited by volunteers in the metroatlanta georgia community is a truly successful model of how to eliminate food waste and hunger perhaps more community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers will consider following their worthy example you might also like",english,legorafi.fr,No Image URL,satire,0.0,après le succès de mariés au premier regard va lancer fécondées au premier regard le gorafi,keywords food packaging packaging one major reasons lots people choose organic foods avoid exposure chemicals however organic foods beans often come packaging done well lots chemicals present greatly interfere normal physiology especially wrong choice packaging company various types food packaging possibly leach compounds food investigate packaging kitchen youll observe lot materials concerned regardless possibility youre part real food type individual presumably canned merchandise oats pastas granola bars packaged plastic bags plastic wrap plastic storage washroom far food refreshment cans seem accounts made metals like steel aluminum reality lined bpa bps deplorable substitutes like polyvinyl chloride pvc contains known cancercausing agent vinyl chloride canned soup soda significantly seltzer juices likely exposing bpa different compounds youre ideal situation ingesting even packaging made evidently amiable paper might lined chemicals concern like pfass found pizza boxes wrapping slick takeout food extra chemicals flame retardants bpa worked way paper packaging laudable efforts recycle paper presented variety different contaminants environmental working group ewg added yet another database arsenal chemical data consumers permitting individuals need avoid exposure toxins check bpa food packaging built database since contend consumers right recognize whats food particularly regards ingredient example bpa linked cancer infertility mind nervous system cardiovascular abnormalities diabetes obesity different genuine disorders theres simple route average consumer discover food stuffed little research demonstrating amount chemicals migrate food wholefood unpackaged eating regimen best safeguard chemicals packaging also important check reputation packaging company positively negatively rated since large number unknowns regards packaging solid option avoid conceivable proper packaging go long way ensuring retain health body one key things making packaging safe entrusting packaging company knows importance eliminating chemicals food stuffs packaging companies careful dealing food packaging foods wrongly without proper care pose risk health ruin name packaging company ways drastically reduce harm may arise food packaging point conceivable avoid canned foods beverages plastic wrap plastic bottles instead pick glass cook beans must buy look reputable packaging companies accomplish greater amount food preservation lessen exposure packaging chemicals go dehydrating gardens harvest storing glass containers avoid putting hot food plastic storage containers heating foods packaged plastic microwave plastics significantly inclined leach chemicals heated experts recommend keeping plastics dishwasher following measures go long way ensuring consume chemicals risky health author bio karen cole freelance writer health beauty niche currently research food packaging wwwallinpackagingcouk helping lot completing research hope like post might also like,0.0

washington  the campaigns of donald trump and hillary clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the white house in january 
a company that makes trump and hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the orthodox jewish clientele 
so far the company picakippa has sold  trump yarmulkes to  for clinton 
my kippa yarmulke company sells trump and hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more uri turk founder and chief kippa officer told wnd we see it as an early exit poll of the orthodox jews a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning once the first debate came around the orders started flying in with much more interest in the trump kippas 
picakippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret idf soldiers from miami turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling trump and hillary custom kippas on its site since august all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more 
our mission is to help jews everywhere show and wear their jewish pride with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas the company says on its website 
it donates  percent of every kippa sale to the lone soldier center in israel assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times 
turk said while american jews have leaned heavily democratic for decades the past few presidential races have seen orthodox jews who make up over  percent of american jewry vote republican in ever increasing numbers he attributes that fact to the democrats putting daylight between america and israel 
a number of influential jewish protrump organizations have emerged chief among them jews choose trump and jewish democrats for trump a recent poll of florida jews showed orthodox voters are leaning toward trump by a  margin 
according to turk picakippa has sold many trump kippas to a congregant of ivanka trumps synagogue on the liberal upper east side of manhattan and has gotten orders for trump kippas from israel australia britain and even mexico picakippa has also gotten hate mail from jews unhappy they are selling the trump designs he says",english,wnd.com,http://mobile.wnd.com/files/2014/10/mm-candy-worried.jpg,bias,1.0,impeachmentera evidence bill clinton still sealed,exrep trump loses im grabbing musket previously tweeted call war obama dallas police shootings published mins ago hill former congressman wednesday threatened grab musket gop nominee donald trump loses presidential election november th im voting trump former rep joe walsh rill tweeted wednesday november th trump loses im grabbing musketyou,1.0

question relating to quantum computing since qubits are what makes up quantum computers that being a qubits can act like a transistor that can be either on off or both on and off at the same time in usual computing transistors are either on or off in quantum they can be both on and off at the same time the question i have is simply this is it possible to make a transistor that can act as on off and on and off at the same time even if you had to add an extra layer of circuitry to get that same reading from that single transistor i mean a normal transistor operate that if it gets no voltage or low voltage then the transistor is in an off state if it gets a certain voltage it is in an on state couldnt you make the voltage extra high to get a both onoff at the same time state or half voltage to get the same onoff state at the same time to essentially create a fake qubit scenario there might have to be additional transistors to help make sure of that determination of a transistor appearing in an onoff state but couldnt it be possible perhaps a circuit of transistors could determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as both onoff by checking the voltage some how idk please answer me like im a drunk stupid idiot perhaps laymen terms i can be quite the idiot sometimes thanks for hearing me out im currently drunk and just pondering things link a reply to darage im sure we could do weird stuff with circuitry to store more than one bit of data in the circuit but that doesnt really give an advantage over just storing more bits with our conventional technology which has been highly refined the advantage of the qbit isnt really that it stores more information its that it can be used to process more information at the same time quantum  computing  quantum computing the key features of an ordinary computerbits registers logic gates algorithms and so onhave analogous features in a quantum computer instead of bits a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits which work in a particularly intriguing way where a bit can store either a zero or a  a qubit can store a zero a one both zero and one or an infinite number of values in betweenand be in multiple states store multiple values at the same time if that sounds confusing think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time schrödingers cat being alive and dead or a car being a bicycle and a bus a gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals if you blow on something like a flute the pipe fills up with a standing wave a wave made up of a fundamental frequency the basic note youre playing and lots of overtones or harmonics higherfrequency multiples of the fundamental the wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously theyre added together to make a combined wave that includes them all qubits use superposition to represent multiple states multiple numeric values simultaneously in a similar way just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once so it can process them simultaneously instead of working in serial doing a series of things one at a time in a sequence it can work in parallel doing multiple things at the same time only when you try to find out what state its actually in at any given moment by measuring it in other words does it collapse into one of its possible statesand that gives you the answer to your problem estimates suggest a quantum computers ability to work in parallel would make it millions of times faster than any conventional computer if only we could build it so how would we do that explainthatstuffcom if i understand correctly a quantum computer will just be a smaller more energy

Joe Kovacs,2016-10-26T22:54:58.597+03:00,limbaugh democrats would destroy jesus christ,"print saeed toosi right and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping  of his students and charged with advocating corruption 
saeed toosi  winner of the first prize for reading the quran both internationally and locally fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi reported al arabiya 
in an audio recording toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and together with the head of irans judicial authority had agreed to a coverup to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a muchneeded dose of truth about the religion of peace 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake one of the victims  a recent firstplace winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was  while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition the mentor according to the charge booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place 
all victims who have filed statements were between  and  at the time of the alleged attacks the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than  countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei current supreme leader of iran he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan last may toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council with many of irans top officials in attendance 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership but officials dismissed their claims citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic 
according to the reformist amad news officials held a twohour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged

trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isnt hard getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that trump is the liar of liars is same thing with bullying but the new york times put together a spread of all the bullyish things trump has said and tweeted and to whom now the toronto star s daniel dale has been tracking trumps lies for just six weeks and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies which you can find here  
there are literally hundreds of lies in trumps speeches theyre not all  unique but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that trump will say anything to smear anyone including his enemies while keeping his supporters happy 
is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much tons of people claim hillary is a master liar but first shes actually more honest than most politicians second even if she could be considered anything like a master liar she still could not compete with trump the liar in any way shape or form 
the star put the lies into a whopping  categories clintons policies wtf daeshmiddle east clintons record african americansinner cities the clintons corruption rigged election tradeeconomy health care trumps endorsements refugeesimmigration polls obamas record the campaign russia trumps record taxes sex assault allegations clintons health and government corruption 
they also compiled a list of the top  types of lies trump has told and gave more detailed analysis beginning with the electoral system is rigged of course its rigged against him 
after plummeting in the polls after the first two debates trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election rigged became his catchword 
he claimed hillary clinton campaign workers hired thugs to cause violence at his rallies twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage clinton he claimed there was widespread voter fraud in philadelphia chicago and st louis  cities with large black populations that heavily favour democrats 
in greeley colo trump told his supporters if they dont trust mailin ballots they should vote again in person so one did trump supporter terri lynn rote a yearold from iowa was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice 
nobodys committing voter suppression and fraud quite like trumpsters and republicans 
another is muslims are risky this touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from syria who could be the great trojan horse of our time 
his claims that syrian refugees   per cent are muslim  are terrorists plays to the fears of the other even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children and their numbers is nowhere near trumps claims  about  have been admitted to the united states in  
the polls favour trump har de har har  trump only looks at the polls he likes and theyre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls very few of the established scientific polls favor him nevertheless 
it seems clear trump manipulates exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is this poll denialism gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data suggests cnn 
his false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling  and perhaps even the vote itself if supporters feel trump should be doing better then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible 
on oct  he said i won the last two debates and every poll showed it in fact every scientific poll showed that he lost 
of course when unscientific online polls came out in his favour trump was quick to promote  and exaggerate  those numbers 
but these are just a few of his biggest most repeated lies he has also falsely said on twitter the failing nytimes reporters dont even call us anymore they just write whatever they want to write making up sources along the way falsely said by open borders hillary means totally unlimited immigration falsely said hillarys plan includes an open border with the middle east falsely called nbc anchor lester holt the moderator of the first debate a democrat falsely said wow just came out on secret tape that crooked hillary wants to take in as many syrians as possible falsely said the us provided iran  billion as part of the nuclear deal falsely said in san bernardino many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed  and wounded many many peoplemuslims have to report the problems when they see them falsely asserted that clinton has been fighting isis her entire adult life falsely said all together the hillary clinton plan would bring in  refugees in her first term falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring nato obsolete because it doesnt cover terror falsely suggested nato created an antiterror position because of his comments falsely claimed clinton didnt release cholesterol or ekg information falsely said sexual assault allegations against him have been largely debunked falsely said apparently of sexual assault accuser summer zervos the one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense falsely said i did not i did not to clintons charge that he thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese falsely said i was against going into iraq and its so welldocumented falsely said our taxes are so high just about the highest in the world 
and so many more just in the last six weeks yes many of them are repeats but lies are lies if trump sees this hell likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the papers lying and continue to sell the myth that hes not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies

WATCH: My Summer Vacation In Croatia,2016-11-03T22:22:02.579+02:00,comment on  tips for having sex with croatian girls by watch my summer vacation in croatia,"over the last decades south korea has emerged as one of the wealthiest countries in all of asia currently the oecd country is roughly on the same material and economic level as other affluent east asian nations such as japan hong kong and taiwan however it appears now as perhaps the most potentially strong among them south korea seems more dynamic and willful than its larger neighbor and economic main rival japan which perhaps has entered the path of a more longterm decline
in this article i do briefly describe the main characteristics of contemporary south korea and also reflect upon various cultural subtopics which are of importance for any male who is interested in to obtain more sophisticated knowledge about nonwestern cultures and what they might and might not offer
the emergence of modern south korea culturally politically technologically and economically south korean development during the th century onward cannot be understood without to mention the strong ties to japan and the united states as much as japan suppressed korea between  the material progression is nevertheless a direct and indirect consequence of the traumatic colonial period korean leaders were also inspired by the japanese military dictatorship which in turn was influenced by european militarism after south koreawhich was formed in  after the divide of the countrystopped relying on american aid and focused on its own potential the economy grew rapidly due to an effective exportoriented industrialization
democracy was gradually introduced in  but some of these authoritarian residues are still visible in todays society the military in particular but also with regard to how many companies are run
presently the economicpolitical relationships between south korea and japan remain flexible and pragmatic for the sake of both countries the ties to the us seems less problematic although koreans negotiate between on one hand a more distinguished korean culture and on the other further western influences
additional ambivalence might also be a result of that some koreans regard american relations as a hinder in the process of a future reunification between the two korean nations generally though the political military and economic cooperation between south korea and the us appears fruitful and to the benefit of both sides
the korean wave and the rising appeal of south korea 
for quite a long time modern south korea may be regarded as not much more than a smaller version of japan although with a unique language and some other differentiating characteristics in postmillennial times however this picture has gradually shiftedboth among other asians westerners and people in other continents tootowards a more appealing national image
the reason for this is mainly material related to a refined development of technology samsung pop music kpop tv dramas kdrama cosmetic products kbeauty and perhaps also a more exciting metropolitan nightlife and a better ranked top university seoul national university the korean wave hallyu covers a whole plethora of different expressions of the rising popularity of south korean products and celebrities and it has had spillover effects for other sectors such as academia and tourism for instance more people are interested in learning korean than  or  years ago
the nightlife in the capital seoul is unhesitatingly of very high standard for instance this year dj mag ranks club octagon in gangnam as the fifth best night club in the entire world  in the city regions gangnam hongdae and itaewon in particular both foreigners and locals can easily find bars and clubs of various sizes that offer highquality entertainment and which conform to a relatively broad spectrum of tastes in music and dress style
cultural characteristics contempory south korean culture can be described as a hybrid of korean east asian and western culture as i have stated above south korea has been influenced by japan and the us in particular to a significant extent this means that the similar real or quasihierarchical structures as in for instance china and japan are visible in south korea too one is expected to speak and behave in different ways depending on a persons age or social rank which are more or less explicitly stated
this does largely overlap a meritocratic social structure rather than status being a primarily inherited factor a doctor is looked upon as socially more valuable than a regular office worker regardless of family background it is thus not much left of the old confucian system
the korean languageeven though about  of the words are based on chinese words and its grammar being partly similar to japaneseis unique with all its different suffixes that in turn conform to different speech and writing levels these can be more or less formal plain and polite but are always related to the social relations and contexts of either speaking or writing people who know each other well tend to use an intimate speech style haeche but in some contexts such as the workplace they might change to a more formal and polite level haeyoche when they walk to other people many who learn korean at a beginners level start with haeyoche and then gradually broaden the scope to include other levels of speaking and writing
apart from the korean language a foreigner may find many things in south korea that are either similar to places such as japan and hong kong or to the western world south korea especially seoul is largely the product of globalization and as a wealthy country this goes along with high standards of infrastructure and general quality of life as a hightech nation it appears as being in the forefront of material development often outshining its western counterparts at least in some ways
the present culture especially the more youthoriented culture is safe and relaxed only slight modifications in dress and behavior towards more politeness and moderation makes any westerner fit in well at least short termwise and to only speak english is seldom a real obstacle
if a person digs deeper into korean history and cultureand geographically move outside the seoul metropolitan areaone may find many differentiating and even somewhat unique characteristics although these do often have china as its root or point of departure but apart from buddhismwhich is separated rather than integrated into the larger societythese elements are seldom manifested in present time there are obviously many real buddhists and christians in present south korea but the traditional layers of culture tend to be mere relics of the past with that said the country as a whole is overall more socially conservative than many western counterparts

whether or not the trend towards increased westernization will continue remains an open question but in terms of technology and popular culture it is unlikely that south korea will look in other directions in the near future after all much of its present infrastructure and popular culture makes it into pretty much a local version of the westernglobal society
lastly two other things that have direct implications for any foreign person who reflects upon the option to stay longer in south korea than as a tourist temporary employee or exchange student is that  the population is very homogeneous and  it has no explicit will to change this fact
this means that it is difficult although not totally impossible to obtain a citizenship if you are not of korean descent south korea uses a type of partial jas sanguinis  citizenship by the blood it is not very uncommon these days that korean men get married to and have children with for instance southeast asian women such as filipinas and south korea is gradually shifting towards a more multiethnic society however compared to many western countries the levels of ethnic and genetic heterogeneity are much much smaller
due to the legal difficulties and cultural differences especially languagewise it is definitely not a smooth process to become naturalized as a korean citizen or resident permanent and temporary living are generally two very different things and south korea is yet another palpable manifestation of that
women in south korea phenotypically south korean women are similar to those of other east asian populations as a result of drastically improved nutrition younger south koreans are relatively tall seemingly not much shorter on average than their western counterparts the levels of obesity are slightly rising but still very low compared to the us canada and even thinner european countries such as italy and sweden overall korean femalesespecially girlscan be characterized as moderately tall and slim
additionally a significant share cares a lot about their appearances fashion diet hair style and makeup are all very important in everyday life and although these things change rapidly due to new trends and seasonal shifts many will ride along the same wave wherever it goes collectivism is quite striking in that respect and subcultures are not as widespread and visible as in japan many look about the same
as with many phenomena in life the extent to which a person likes or dislikes how a population generally appears is related to individual taste with that said i think that more objectively speaking the two main strengths of korean girls and younger women are that they are relatively thin and wellgroomed they do everything they can to optimize their beauty potentials sometimes even with the help of plastic surgery which will make them look somewhat more european which partly is an ideal among east asian populations

additionallyeven if this stems more from observations and anecdotes than general factsthey tend to be more polite and welleducated in a positive sense than western females this is something they also have in common with other well off asians such as japanese taiwanese and singaporeans in the more exciting locations of seoul one will find quite many pretty and decent korean girls and even though hookup culture has for good and for bad penetrated the south of the korean peninsula a significant share of these females may be looked upon as serious girlfriend material
western guys do have a comparative advantage in terms of looks and even sometimes behavior korean guys tend to lack the cockiness of westerners but these automatic benefits should not be overemphasized many of the things that girls are attracted to such as confidence extroversion and good looks are general close to universal traits if one is a loser in the west then one will probably be that in the east as well conversely the more alpha males will magnify their results if they have the proper time and opportunity to do so
conclusion overall south korea is a rather impressive modern society that shares many of the good features with its equally rich neighbors however recently it has seemingly surpassed places like japan and hong kong in terms of material development nightlife and popular culture for some western males between the ages of  south korea might offer a valuable opportunity for temporaryranging from weeks to even years and circular migration because eventually it is most likely time to go home regardless if one wishes it or not

Letsbereal,2016-10-26T17:14:00.000+03:00,no title,"home this month popular  tips for having sex with croatian girls  tips for having sex with croatian girls february    comments travel day game 
 croatian girls are extremely receptive to day game they want to be opened even if she has headphones and seems focused on her music it can still go well same goes for girls on rollerblades excuse me where can i buy rollerblades like yours 
 croatia is one of those places where both indirect and direct game work pick one that suits the venue and your personality what i did was open indirect chat for a couple minutes and then hit her with a compliment about her positive energy to see how shed respond if she smiled i knew i was in 
 girls will give you their number even if they have a boyfriend it may not come out until the first meeting to avoid this when i was getting a number id jokingly say youre not married right if she had a boyfriend she would then announce it with a guilty look on her face 
 always go for the instadate especially if youre doing street game not only will this weed out flakey girls but it gives you an opportunity to find out what she wants in life croatia has a lot of good girls who dont drink at all and want a serious relationship you want to dump those prospects if youre not staying long 
 a common issue youll find on the first date is girls who want to bring their friends along dont let them or youll get stuck in a hellish group chat its either a on date or nothing night game 
 you need to push the interaction as far as you can go if you dont at least get a kiss the odds that number will lead to a date is  or less if you get a passionate kiss with some handholding at the end over  its easy to get a number from a croatian girl but you should resist push for the kiss its similar to what you should do in america 
 absolutely do not add a croatian girl to facebook they are accomplished attention whores and will string you along if you didnt at least get a phone number you got nothing 
 cockblocking is a huge problem the best way to fight it is to be more selective about the venues you choose large clubs have the hottest girls but they are harder to approach and you will end up getting cockblocked incessantly hipster bars have the ugliest girls but youll rarely get cockblocked experiment in the city to find something in the middle that has the best balance between beauty and attitude so much of a successful croatian experience will be based on the venue going from the best venue to the worst you may even feel like youre in a different country as a general rule if youre in a club where the girls arent genuinely excited youre a foreigner you should go somewhere else 
 since so many girls go out in pairs its better to roll with a wingman than solo dolo a problem youll face if you re going out solo is that a girl doesnt want to leave her friend alone what i did was approach girls whose friend was already getting hit on by another guy 
 dont compliment at night  croatian girls already have an elevated perception of themselves and get compliments all the time they are not insecure as girls from the baltics or ukraine  
 dont call a girl before you bang her they rarely answer text instead 
 croatia is slowly embracing onenight stands with the right logistics you should be able to get them they are far easier than a place like ukraine the key here is having tight logistics it should be so tight that you can take a walk with her and be at your place to hop in for a quick drink the girls who are most likely to go for this will be  and who want a taste of the american sexual culture older women will be able to resist your logistical game 
 similar to the above point all your dates should be close to your apartment if your date venue is more than half a mile away youre already shooting yourself in the foot even if a croatian girl is playing aloof she can turn on a dime once in a private room 
 the less snobby the club the more acceptable it is to buy a girl a drink without getting punished for it croatia isnt like other eastern european countries where girls are generally upfront and honest with their intentionsthey will play you if you give them the opportunity especially the higher end venues generally speaking as long as she didnt have a bitch face when you first approached her you should be in the clear to buy a drink  
 the best game for zagreb the capital is to have the best logistics possible sadly croatian girls flake more than average so you want the proximity of your apartment to act as bait for casual hangouts that turn into bangs unless youre dealing with an older croatian girl who is into you youll have to play the numbers game and not get hung up on any one girl get ready to meet some hardcore female players 
 if you put x hours a day into day game and x hours into night game youll be rewarded with night game first you can get surprisingly fast bangs at night that day game doesnt provide mostly because aggressive night game easily screens out day girls who are simply bored but not really hankering for dick if i go back to croatia ill just move right next to a good bar",english,prisonplanet.com,No

donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day trump tweeted monday morning why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive 
its a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process 
states backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process sen jeff flake of arizona who is often sharply critical of trump tweeted sunday elections are not rigged 
jon husted the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged 
trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls before now trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august 
and im telling you november  wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august and i hope the republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us 
multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election 
allen raymond a former gop operative who was involved in the  new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the republic 
the idea that its rigged i dont know what hes talking about he said in august i know someone that rigged elections i mean you know the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesnt need to rig this election trumps going to win alabama and thats it she doesnt have to do anything its painful to watch 
raymond wrote how to rig an election confessions of a republican operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the  new hampshire senate election between thengov jeanne shaheen a democrat and republican us rep john e sununu raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out sununu went on to win the election by roughly  votes shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in  
the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementhe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what trumps talking about 
the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in  against republican nominee mitt romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican 
i dont even know what hes talking about raymond said but this idea that its  or  and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense an election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about now its stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire 
he said the lack of voterid laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus 
these voterid laws whats the intention of that the clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterid laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots you know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore because its unconstitutional 
people dont vote  times he continued there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort its a total myth 
he said trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline hillary clintons first four years in office 
the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both trump and sen bernie sanders of vermont clintons main opponent in the democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season the emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored clinton 
trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against sanders in his earlyaugust interview with hannity in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail he used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/1477586227636130853168961052.jpg,conspiracy,0.0,trump warns world war iii clinton elected,email donald trump riling voting base claims november election rigged course large scale voter fraud happening election day trump tweeted monday morning republican leaders deny going naive charge even republicans quick refute critics called talk potentially dangerous detrimental trust us democratic process states backed tens thousands gop dem volunteers ensure integrity electoral process sen jeff flake arizona often sharply critical trump tweeted sunday elections rigged jon husted secretary state ohio top election official key battleground state also said monday could assure trump election would rigged trumps recent claims coincided plunge polls trump recently made similar claims polls numbers taking dive early august im telling november wed better careful election going rigged new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity august hope republicans watching closely going taken away us multiple republicans told business insider time trumps assertion ludicrous dangerous trump would first us presidential candidate modern times possibly ever blame election loss voter fraud rigged election allen raymond former gop operative involved new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence election would rigged detrimental republic idea rigged dont know hes talking said august know someone rigged elections mean know fact matter hillary clinton doesnt need rig election trumps going win alabama thats doesnt anything painful watch raymond wrote rig election confessions republican operative tellall attempt rig new hampshire senate election thengov jeanne shaheen democrat republican us rep john e sununu raymond said attempted rigging centered jamming phone lines new hampshire democrats office manchester task phone bank hired carry sununu went win election roughly votes shaheen defeated sununu rematch operative served brief prison sentence involvementhe said attempts rig election would look similar trumps talking manhattan billionaire told washington post august lack voteridentification laws would let people keep voting voting voting suggested fraud occurred republican nominee mitt romney precincts practically nobody voting republican dont even know hes talking raymond said idea party bosses going roll pittsburgh philadelphia going rig ballot box rig machines thats nonsense election rigging days means something totally different hes talking stupid stuff like new hampshire said lack voterid laws trump trying use proof fraud fall also bogus voterid laws whats intention clear intention disenfranchisement said echoing common complaint liberal circles voterid laws put place prevent minority voting blocks able cast ballots know theres reason dont poll tax anymore unconstitutional people dont vote times continued might one bad actor every tries vote couple times hes talking institutional effort total myth said trumps statements attempt basically sideline hillary clintons first four years office idea rigged election came forefront democratic national committee emails hacked leaked though trump sen bernie sanders vermont clintons main opponent democratic primary claimed electoral system rigged earlier primary season emails showed organization supposed remain neutral throughout primary favored clinton trump said email leak proved primary election rigged sanders earlyaugust interview hannity addition claims perpetuated along campaign trail used leak evidence fall election would rigged well,1.0

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-30T02:33:26.184+02:00,obamas un ambassador cuba is right about our human rights,"obamas attorney general warned fbi director not to inform congress of new hillary investigation   
the media is shamelessly spinning this corrupt behavior by attorney general lynch as standard protocol and blasting the fbi from deviating from some imaginary standard in which democratic presidential candidates are supposed to be immune from the consequences of their criminality  and congress is meant to be kept in the dark 
attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates disagreed with fbi director james comeys decision to notify congress about his bureaus review of emails potentially related to hillary clintons personal server law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said 
there was no direct confrontation between lynch or yates and comey instead the disagreements were conveyed to comey by justice department staff who advised the fbi chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election the officials said 
it is in line with policy though for lynch to have met with bill clinton 
but yes a hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate 
comeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter friday anyway shaking the presidential race  days before the election and nearly four months after the fbi chief said he wouldnt recommend criminal charges over the democratic nominees use of the server 
the officials acknowledged there was little lynch and yates could do given the fallout over lynchs controversial meeting over the summer with former president bill clinton 
note how the media is spinning this as comeys drastic course of action while lynch is just being a responsible public servant the default assumption is that comey is in the wrong for providing information to one of the major branches of government and the greater public",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/big-sister-600x337_2.jpg?itok=EmETEtUf,hate,1.0,huma abedin swore oath emails lied,sioux indians wish dakota pipeline protesters would go home october daniel greenfield ecoloons protesting dakota pipeline support media white house many local sioux dont see defenders wish would go home ask around youll hear stories pipeline protesters whove traveled great distances theyve come japan russia germany australia israel serbia course allies exclusively native american indigenous whove flocked corners us demonstrating proud daily work obnoxious leftists world united want pipelines showers one makes clearer robert fool bear sr district chairman cannon ball town runs estimated population miles action close given faceoffs law enforcement pass police checkpoint reach time people heard folks like says fool bear protesters says two years ago members standing rock sioux tribe could attended hearings make concerns known didnt care suddenly crowds control fears matter time someone gets seriously hurt go camps says wont see many standing rock sioux irks people world says could come planets think would sioux stuck helping leftist idiot protesters long ago found three teenage girls ontario canada camped inside storage shed white woman spokane washington came see help saying shed come nothing car broken casino recently someone approached two young kids parents arrested even though fool bear protests doesnt mean hes preparing help people anticipates opening community gymnasium people without beds come winter growing pile sleeping bags blankets sits office protesters arizona georgia california wont know hit cold rushes says instead helping sioux privileged leftists become burden take care,1.0
Alex Ansary,2016-11-07T20:01:08.718+02:00,kremlin nato was created for agression,"janet reno first female us attorney general dies at   
npr 
janet reno the first woman to serve as attorney general of the united states died early monday from complications of parkinsons disease renos goddaughter gabrielle dalemberte and sister margaret hurchalla confirmed her passing to npr 
reno spent her final days at home in miami surrounded by family and friends dalemberte told the associated press she was  
reno served longer in the job than anyone had in  years and her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy but she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments 
she was not president bill clintons first choice to head the justice department nor his second but after his no  pick went down in confirmation flames and his second choice also proved controversial clinton finally turned to reno 
she was an unexpected pick she had no connections to clinton or washington but clinton wanted a woman and reno was a bigtime prosecutor holding the top prosecutors job in miamidade county a position she had been elected to four times over  years 
jamie gorelick who would later become deputy attorney general was assigned to prep reno for her confirmation hearing she was the least airbrushed candidate we have ever had for a cabinetlevel position says gorelick she was herself and she didnt change herself for washington 
reno arrived at the justice department knowing no one and was immediately plunged into the siege at the branch davidian compound outside waco texas four federal agents had been killed and  wounded while serving a warrant to search for illegal guns seven weeks into the siege pressed by the fbi reno authorized a raid on the compound resulting in  deaths including as many as  children and the davidian leader david koresh who ordered his followers to set fire to the compound 
in two sets of waco congressional hearings over the next two years reno would successfully quell critics on the right and left 
what haunted me reno explained at one hearing was that if i did not go in i might be sitting there  days later  when koresh came out with explosives blew himself some agents and the entire place up 
years later however in an interview with npr shortly before leaving office her regret was palpable well never know whether it was a mistake or not in one sense reno admitted but knowing what i do i would not do it again i would try to figure another way 
waco didnt make her hesitant it made her insistent about getting her own information observes walter dellinger who served in two top justice department jobs under reno 
dellinger believes for instance that it may have been the waco experience that led reno to go personally to miami in april  to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of yearold cuban refugee elián gonzález from the home of a greatuncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent in cuba 
elián had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the united states rescued by fishermen and brought to the us he was soon turned over to his greatuncle the cuban community in miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father who lived in cuba and the furor soon bled over to congress 
but when negotiations with the greatuncle failed armed federal agents acting on renos orders raided the home removed elián and turned him over to his father who had come to the us to receive his son when the us supreme court refused to intervene the two returned to their home in cuba 
janet reno takes the oath as attorney general during a ceremony at the white house on march   while president bill clinton watches 
barry thummaap 
over the course of time reno would become embroiled in many controversies she sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow cabinet members and president clinton himself but she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the clintongore campaign after justice department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president 
the decision so infuriated republicans that some called for her impeachment this is the most politicized justice department in the history of the united states railed dan burton the republican chairman of a key house oversight committee 
at  feet  inches however reno stood tall in the political crosswinds gorelick observes that when members of congress like burton were unhappy with a government official they threatened to call that official to testify but reno who had served as a staffer in the florida state legislature always said fine ill be there as a result says gorelick eventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that because she prevailed in every outing that i can recall  she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her 
the controversies that the justice department faced during renos reign often eclipsed the many things that went well the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the oklahoma city bombers for example the pursuit of bombers of womens health clinics that provide abortions and the solving of the socalled unabomber case 
after nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit the fbi still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the unabomber who had killed three people and injured  then in  the bomber sent a letter to the new york times offering to cease his terror campaign if the times or the washington post would publish his word manifesto against modern industry and technology neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially but reno the daughter of two newspaper journalists persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety 
it paid off the unabombers brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the fbi ending the bombers long reign of terror theodore kaczynski aka the unabomber is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison 
in  reno was diagnosed with parkinsons disease she did not slow down but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing she even joked about the disease claiming that shaking sometimes helps as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak 
that combination of toughness and selfdeprecating humor plus her determination to protect the justice department from improper influence made her a hero to many who worked for her 
janet reno led with her values says former deputy attorney general gorelick the departments no  official and that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her  id never seen that before in quite the same way 
florida gubernatorial candidate and former us attorney general janet reno speaks at the florida democratic party state conference on april   in lake buena vista fla she lost the democratic primary 
reno won enormous respect inside the department as well because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the justice department  from national security to environmental questions to the generally obscure field of indian law 
us attorney general loretta lynch called her one of the most effective decisive and wellrespectedleaders in the departments proud history who never shied from criticism or shirked responsibility and former attorney general eric holder said that in a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain janet reno stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values 
former solicitor general dellinger believes that reno was prepared for the attorney generals job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height this is a woman that went to cornell and harvard law school at a time when very few women went to harvard law school went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart  and thats really really tough 
there were of course ups and downs in the eight years of renos reign but she said she always took the long view of her job 
if the end brings me out right what people said about me wont make any difference and if the end brings me out wrong  angels saying i was right wont make any difference she said in an interview with npr in  
president clinton made little secret of his frequent displeasure with reno and the wall of separation she erected between the justice department and the white house still he never asked her to resign reno was the last cabinet member he reappointed after his reelection in  
it was actually quite wonderful said dellinger she just decided to stay and it turns out that nobody could fire her 
the tension between clinton and his attorney general was apparent even as clintons time in office drew to a close in an interview with cbs news  minutes  clinton went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike but when it came to his evaluation of reno he was tepid to say the least 
good woman he said tried really hard to do a good job shes a good person 
at least he didnt say i was a bad person replied reno with a laugh ill take what i can get 
indeed by the end of her tenure janet reno had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian will ferrells parody of her became one of the iconic skits on nbcs saturday night live  the recurring skit was inspired by reports that reno had cut quite a figure dancing at a justice department party 
on the last episode of the janet renos dance party parody ferrell wearing a blue dress and pearls reminisces about past glories and laments that the end of the party is near then suddenly the real janet reno comes crashing through the wall of the set wearing the same blue dress and pearls as ferrell to deliver one of ferrells signature lines its reno time 
oh janet he says to the real reno as he mourns the end of the skits run what do you do when you get sad

convenience store beginning in june the new minimum age for officially jumped from  to  a prohibition move that lawmakers claim will curb the number of smokers in the golden state and ultimately help save livesjoining both hawaii and the city of needham in massachusetts california is the third locale in the us to raise the legal smoking age to  officials there hope that like in these other places age restrictions on smoking will help reduce the number of smokers and minimize the number of individuals who develop smokingrelated health conditions like emphysema and lung cancerciting statistics from needham that show a nearly  percent reduction in the number of smokers in the fiveyear period following the change that was made in  april roeseler head of the california public health departments tobacco control program told the los angeles times that she expects similar reductions in her statein needham the number of high schoolers smoking cigarettes fell by nearly half according to a study published last year and adult smoking rates in the town also fell from about  percent to a mere  percent  statistics that experts say can be replicated all across the countryif we can push that age up where fewer and fewer people start smoking as a teen its likely that we will start to have some tobaccofree generations  the times quotes her as saying prohibition never works people who want contraband will find a way at this point though very little if any evidence exists to show that the rule change is working as intended university of california san francisco ucsf professor dr stanton glantz for instance admitted to the times that the policy still needs time to settle in the california smokers helpline also says it hasnt noticed any increases in the number of callers in the prohibited age range trying to quit which suggests that not much has changedtheres also the contraband factor  older kids still buying cigarettes for younger kids for example including those younger than the former threshold age of  illegal buying has always been an issue law or no law which is something that the government never really seems to understand when it comes to issues of prohibition theyre hanging out and partying together so theyll just get someone else to buy says leonard charles the owner of a liquor store in oakland charles says he strictly enforces the new cigarette age law but believes that if somebody wants cigarettes he or she is going to find a way regardless of the lawin the internet age cigarettes are also freely available to anybody with a wifi connection people can order cigarettes off the web and have them delivered right to their doorstep which means that statelevel restrictions are basically mootand what about ecigarettes the state of california classifies ecigs as a tobacco product just like cigarettes and they are subject to the same laws however everybody has them these days theyre very discreet and they dont produce that typical tobacco smell thats so hard to get out of a room  so trying to enforce restrictions against their use is next to impossible say experts familiar with the reality of how easy it is to obtain tobacco regardless of what the law sayswhen asked how the new law will realistically work in light of the fact that smoking laws often arent effective glantz responded the short answer is i dont know sources for this

military officials in tunisia have rejected claims that the country is hosting a base for us drone operations against the daesh takfiri terrorist group in neighboring libya 
tunisias defense minister farhat horchani on thursday ruled out any possibility that foreign forces could have direct access to tunisian military bases or run their own in the country 
we dont  and wont  have a foreign military base in tunisia horchani said adding we were one of the few first countries to oppose a foreign military intervention in libya 
a tunisian defense ministry spokesman also said on thursday that the north african country has never allowed washington to operate unmanned planes from its territory for antidaesh missions 
tunisian soil has never been and never will be used to strike targets in libya the drones are used by tunisians and no one else belhassen oueslati said adding as part of tunisianus bilateral cooperation we have acquired drones to train our military personnel to use this technology and to control our southeastern border with libya and detect any suspicious movement 
the remarks came after us media claimed that washington has expanded its deployment of drones to north africa as part of a secret program 
a report by the washington post said on wednesday that unmanned aircraft and us military personnel had been deployed to a facility in tunisia to conduct spy missions in neighboring libya the paper added that drones began flying out of the tunisian base in late june claiming that the dispatch of the planes was a key element of the extended us air offensive against a daesh stronghold in libya 
daesh which is known for its terror acts in iraq and syria has been operating mostly in northern libya a country which slipped into chaos in  following the ouster of longtime dictator muammar gaddafi 
forces loyal to libyas unity government which enjoy the support of the west and the united nations have been battling daesh militants over the past six months in the coastal city of sirte 
us africa command africom said on thursday that since august  pentagon has carried out  airstrikes in libya to help libyan forces in the fight in sirte 
there are us service members working with the tunisian security forces for counterterrorism and they are sharing intelligence from various sources to include unarmed aerial platforms said colonel mark r cheadle spokesman for us africa command

Letsbereal,2016-10-26T17:20:00.000+03:00,nintendo cuts fullyear sales operating profit forecasts,"by day i work in a scrap yard it is not glamorous but glamour does not pay my bills in the evening i teach in a welding program at a community college
like many others i once bought into the fallacy that you need a piece of paper from a university to succeed in life at the age of thirty i graduated from a university with an undergraduate degree and the customary debt which came along with it twentynine years later i see how wrong i was
soon after graduating i obtained an office job and moved to a city where i knew no one the job i was so optimistic about turned out to be like marriage to a crack whore each day was as if walking through a minefield full of dysfunctional women emasculated men drama backstabbing catfights and every other problem associated with modern workplaces worse yet the cut male managers allowed trim to be in charge resulting in a fucked up toxic culture after three tumultuous and abusive years i found myself unceremoniously kicked to the curb and surprisingly relieved
after a lengthy stint of unemployment i landed an entrylevel job in a metal fabrication company one of the benefits offered was tuition reimbursement for work related classes i enrolled in welding classes at night and upgraded my skills all on my employers dime
i immediately noticed a difference from my previous job i worked exclusively with men except for a few token assholes the men liked their solitude did their jobs and left each other alone the work was varied creative and with overtime the pay was decent the fact that i had a work ethic showed up every day on time and desired to learn earned me respect quickly
i eventually went down a different path but returned to welding parttime as an adjunct instructor
welding is the joining of two metal pieces or parts by applying heat a filler metal or electrode helps to make the joint power source supplies electricity required for heat and a shielding gas or fluxcovered electrode aids in the welding process
the most common welding processes are gas metal arc welding gmaw flux core arc welding fcaw gas tungsten arc welding gtaw and shielded metal arc welding smaw of these gas metal arc welding is the easiest to learn and offers the fastest production welding involves both ferrous steel and nonferrous metals aluminum stainless steel
why welding  according to a bureau of labor report the need for welders will grow by  percent by 
 according to a national association of manufacturers report nearly  percent of manufacturers in the united states report that they cannot find skilled welders to meet demand
 the american welding society reports that the average age for a welder is now in the midfifties
 entrylevel wages in my region average  annually with skilled welders earning  and more after five years in the trade
i frequently hear from employers who are desperate for skilled welders one plant manager told me there are too many computer jockeys and not enough people who can weld and turn a wrench another manufacturer told me we have over a dozen welders retiring and no one to replace them further the school i teach at has more jobs available than they have students enrolled
what welders do welders work in manufacturing construction maintenance repair facilities and service companies welders typically work eighthour shifts and a fiveday week but overtime is common welders often perform other duties like operating metal fabrication equipment and doing assembly work
the more skills a welder develops the more value and earning potential he has for example being able to weld cut and fit up metals and read weld symbols and prints will command a higher wage becoming certified in certain weld procedures also increases a welders wages and marketability
qualifications 
welding is the quintessential bluecollar job it is physically demanding hot dirty and requires a high degree of skill other personal characteristics are good eyesight and hand eye coordination good manual dexterity and good concentration
training community colleges offer affordable training for entrylevel jobs in welding most programs are nine months but my school also offers a sixteenweek work ready certificate in welding students learn common welding processes thermal cutting processes and blueprint reading unlike the typical ivory palace college professors instructors are required to have a minimum of three years related and verifiable industrial experience job placement is also good
additional facts 
despite a decent paying skill in high demand clueless parents and educators continue to dissuade young men from entering bluecollar trades like welding the result has been an entire generation of young men ruined by hostile fouryear colleges worthless degrees and insurmountable debt
perhaps you are a perceptive and bright young rok reader considering a career change in closing consider these facts
 you will always have employment as a welder
 welding skills are highly transferable you can carry these skills to your next and often higher paying job
 unlike many whitecollar corporate jobs of today the average welders wages increase with skill overtime merit increases and production bonuses are common benefits for welders
 at the end of your shift you can leave your job at the door
 welding offers a level of creativity solitude and seeing the fruits of your labor studies show that welders machinists and other bluecollar trades have lower suicide rates than many whitecollar professions
 welding is often a gateway trade into other even higher paying trades like machinist multicraft machinery maintenance and millwright
 welding is a male dominated occupation traditionalist men will find it offers some insulation and respite from the typical feminist diatribe and pc bullshit of todays corporate world
conclusion how has welding benefited me first i developed reasoning skills something that academia failed to do i also developed a thorough understanding of how men do the dirty nasty and dangerous jobs in this life feminists and elitists can marginalize men all they want but men risk their lives and health to build and maintain their shit
further welding has opened some doors for me mainly teaching my ultimate goal is to teach welding fulltime a late life career change if you will and one i hope will happen

gop nominee donald trump does not believe that settlements built by the zionist regime of israel in palestine are illegal his advisor on israel says 
david friedman who was campaigning for the new york billionaire at a restaurant on mount zion jabel sahyoun in east jerusalem alquds made the comments to afp after the wednesday rally 
i dont think he believes that the settlements are illegal friedman said 
he also said the former reality tv star is tremendously skeptical about the socalled twostate solution promoted by the democratic administration of president barack obama during his eight years in office but to no avail david friedman l exiting the federal building with donald trump and ivanka trump r following their appearance in us bankruptcy court in camden new jersey february   photo via bloomberg news 
the obama administration has already voiced criticism over tel avivs expansionist policies considered illegal by the international community 
the presence and continued expansion of israeli settlements in the occupied palestine has created a major obstacle for the efforts to establish peace in the middle east 
over half a million israelis live in more than  illegal settlements built since the  israeli occupation of the palestinian territories of the west bank a palestinian man searches through his belongings after his family home was demolished by israelis in beit hanina near the israeli settlement of ramat shlomo background in east jerusalm alquds on october   photo by afp 
all israeli settlements are illegal under the international law tel aviv has defied calls to stop the settlement expansion in the occupied palestinian territories 
guaranteeing enmity with tehran 
some  people including extremist israelis and evangelical christians took part in the trump rally in on wednesday 
friedman echoed previous remarks by trump saying the real estate mogul would recognize east jerusalem alquds as the capital of israel if he wins the white house in the us  presidential election 
a short video message by trump was also played at the event in which he said together we will stand up to the enemies like iran bent on destroying israel and her people trump said together we will make america and israel safe again

for at least the second time in the last several days cameras captured hillary clintons eyes acting strangely 
the behavior which doctors have told the american mirror appears to be disconjugate gaze  a common symptom of increased intracranial pressure or swelling of the brain  was evident again during a rally on wednesday in lake worth florida 
here are several more of the instances from today 
despite getting major coverage on the drudge report no mainstream news outlet has covered the apparent issue with clintons eyes 
but the several instances over the last few weeks and as recently as last friday  have been enough for doctors to publicly call on clinton to undergo a full medical example and release the results 
my rational self would say that they could have defused all this a long time ago by releasing her medical records and having her undergo the same type of neurologic exam that every high school football player in america who gets his bell rung on friday night must undergo before he can suit up for the game next friday dr john r coppedge a surgical specialist from texas told the american mirror  a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
she needs a full neurology evaluation neuroopthalmology evaluation mri cerebral venography and a lumbar puncture dr gerald gianoli an expert in intracranial pressure said to this news site 
it is possible that her status could be significantly improved but at the same time she risks demonstrating to the public that her medical problems are more serious than she has let on in the past 
gianoli who believes the condition could be the result of elevated pressure which can cause other problems 
it can lead to blindness deafness progressive vertigobalance problems seizuresstroke and continued problems with concentration memory and ability to mentally focus he said

california isnt even close to a swing state in the  presidential election but that doesnt mean nothing is at stake for voters in the nations largest state 
after tuesdays vote hundreds of thousands of california schoolchildren may start attending classes primarily en español thanks to a voter referendum that would repeal the requirement that schools teach primarily in english 
californias proposition  would repeal proposition   a measure that easily passed nearly two decades ago in  proposition  required all public schools in the state teach overwhelmingly in english with limitedenglish proficiency lep students transitioning to fully english classes as quickly as possible 
snip 
across the state the english proficiency of lep students tripled in just a few years  and math scores rose as well 
but now with californias immigrant population higher than ever the state is poised to reverse course 
polls indicate the proposition  is likely to pass ironically supporters of the measure place an emphasis on english rather than foreign tongues they argue that the bill will allow for dual immersion programs where both native english and native spanish speakers can learn in a bilingual environment in the long run they argue this will increase multilingualism and provide the state with a competitive advantage

 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
the american people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately the director himself has said he doesnt know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not the democratic nominee said 
thats why its incumbent on the fbi to tell us what theyre talking about clinton said 
clinton pushed for more information to be released without delay she said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasnt given advance notice clinton said she had not been contacted by comey on this issue 
when asked what she would tell voters about her emails clinton responded i think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails 
this might be the right place to mention the  million emails the bush administration lost and the private rnc servers they used as context for how important this issue really is to republicans as a value 
kristen welker asked if clinton was afraid that this could sink her campaign to which secretary clinton responded with a big laugh are you worried this could sink your campaign secretary clinton a reporter shouts as hrc walks out clinton only lets out a big laugh 
 ruby cramer rubycramer october   
the republican fbi director james comey wrote the house on friday to inform hopeful republicans that they had found new emails relating to clintons private email that begged further investigation 
it turns out the emails didnt come from clintons server and there doesnt seem to be any there there except for giving republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote 
federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against comey  
hillary clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point how many years on is this republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long its doa the press has followed republicans lead with the absurd email story a story as ridiculous as it is common and a story that was never a story until clinton did it 
republicans and some in the press think this might sink the clinton campaign so they think america would rather put putins puppet who laughs about sexually assaulting women in the white house than someone whose emails weve all read now and found nothing much but gossip

shawn helton st century wire 
the cozy relationship between goldman sachs and the clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years giving the democratic party nominee hillary clinton an immensely influential partner on wall street 
as the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened fbi probe into the hillary clinton s email server case  the global investment banking firm goldman sachs quietly endorsed the democratic presidential candidate this past week 
the financial ties that bind the clintons and wall street banks like goldman sachs are nothing new but never before have the connections been so exposed lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago 
money changers wall streets goldman sachs are inextricably linked to the clintons and the clinton foundation photo illustration wire 
the clintons  goldman sachs 
while campaigning for his first term in the white house former president bill clinton received an enormous amount of support from washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on wall street 
at the top of the pile sat goldman sachs 
in  the la times reported that presidential nominee bill clinton received the largest share of his financial supportat least  millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists and that clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as goldman sachs  co in new york and stephens inc in his hometown of little rock ark in fact goldman sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm  
for decades the clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth goldman sachs and in the process a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold something that even the ny times admits 
over plus years goldman provided the clintons with some of their most influential advisers millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs 
by now there should be little doubt that the clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the wall street banking cartel their relationship was built over three decades 
the real watershed moment came here 
blank check bill clinton laughs with wall street elites after signing the financial services modernization act in  
key to the kingdom 
in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely 
the clintongoldman sachswall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glasssteagall act  which banking luminaries cynically named the  financial services modernization act of  officially titled the gramm leachbliley act  the original glasssteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the bank act of  that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors  the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression  in fact the grammleachbliley act which repealed glasssteagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked 
simply put clintons repeal of glasssteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking  which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite  which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in  all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really 
in a crossposted article featured at huffington post  nomi prins underscored the complicit nature of wall street and washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the clinton administration during the s 
to grasp the dangers that the big six banks jpmorgan chase citigroup bank of america wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world you need to understand their history in washington starting with the clinton years of the s alliances established then not exclusively with democrats since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital rest assured of one thing their past and present ceos will prove as critical in backing a hillary clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husbands years in office 
prins herself was a former managing director at goldman sachs senior managing director at bear stearns as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm lehman brothers following the financial crash in  prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  it takes a pillage  behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from washington to wall street 
prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the glasssteagall act since departing from the investment banking world 
the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group becoming citigroup which was dubbed the cititravelers act on capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glasssteagall 
then in  in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act  but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glasssteagall would be repealed citigroups cochairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut 
at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal  as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther  in   after  attempts in  years congress passed the financial services modernization act  which led to the repeal of glasssteagall 
the repeal of glasssteagall was pushed heavily by citigroups coceo sanford weill and lobbyist roger levy and according to a report by the nation  
they laid out more than  million for lobbying in  according to the center for responsive politics and donated more than  million in the  election cyclea figure sure to be topped in  
how much of those contributions made their way to the clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the white house 
in  bill clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private goldman events 
in  after stepping down from her position as secretary of state hillary clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at goldman sachs events to the tune of  dollars in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a goldman sachs managing director according to a quote obtained by politico  indeed clinton gave a glowing speech to the goldman gang and in the process as wikileaks released in early october  the democratic nominee believes in both a public and a private position on wall street reform and that it is an  oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis 
that clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics but its only the tip of a much larger iceberg 
in  the washington post reported that hillary rodham clinton and former president bill clinton earned in excess of  million for delivering  speeches since the beginning of  a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid 
anointed chelsea clinton with goldman sachsbacked hedge funder marc mezvinsky 
the clinton family is chockfull of banking connections as chelsea clinton joined the avenue capital group which according to reports is a  billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many democratic party campaigns chelsea is married to marc mezvinsky  a former investment banker for goldman sachs chelseas tenure at avenue capital group was from  just prior to hillary clintons run for president in  since then chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the clinton foundation 
marc mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently eaglevale hellenic opportunity  after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of  million  after blowing the money on secondhand junk greek bank stocks and toxic government debt 
the apple doesnt fall far from the tree 
as it turns out marc is the son of troubled former congressman ed mezvinsky  another close friend of team clinton 
politico reports on one of ed mezvinskys financial controversies in  
in the waning days of clintons presidency federal prosecutors and the fbi were bearing down on former rep ed mezvinsky diowa who had fallen for a series of ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly  million money from other investors to cover his losses  
continuing politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from ed mezvinskys wife to then president bill clinton 
records released last week by the clinton presidential library in little rock and obtained by politico show mezvinsky and his thenwife  exrep marjorie margoliesmezvinsky dpa  pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case 
in  the daily mail reported the following chelsea clintons husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the greek economy and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds marc mezvinsky  and his partners former goldman sachs colleagues bennett grau and mark mallon raised million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation that fund however has lost  percent of its value investors with direct knowledge of the situation told the new york times  and will now be closed

the ny times further outlined the longheld clintongoldman connection just two years before the  financial crisis the clintons relationships with wall street deepened in the s when mr clinton set up his foundation in harlem and mrs clinton was elected to the senate from new york that brought her in close touch with the big wall street firms a source of jobs and tax revenue for new york  and a leading source of campaign funds for mrs clinton during her years in congress employees of goldman donated in excess of  to mrs clinton more than those of any other company except citigroup according to the center for responsive politics along with other new york politicians mrs clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate lower manhattan after the sept   attacks and those breaks helped goldman build its new roughly  billion headquarters when it broke ground in  mrs clinton and other new york officials were onsite how to monetize influence lloyd blankfein at a clinton global initiative event with hillary clinton image source sputniknews  the wall street racket to understand who powers the clinton foundations billion dollar rico influencepeddling slush fund you need to understand how money is laundered between wall street and washington dc goldman sachs jpmorgan chase morgan stanley bank of america and citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the  crash then in april of  goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for  billion dollars cnbc reported the following 
goldman sachs will pay  billion to settle federal and state probes into the banks sale of mortgagebacked securities before the financial crisis the justice department announced monday 
authorities said goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and  crisis the settlement includes a  billion civil penalty  billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and  million to resolve various other claims 
this resolution holds goldman sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail acting associate attorney general stuart delery said in a statement  
in  a bloomberg article questioned how goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the  economic crisis 
whether goldman could have gone the way of lehman brothers or merrill lynch remains the subject of much debate goldman maintains that it did not need or want the  billion bailout that hank paulson  former goldman alum pushed on it and other firms in october  but the fact remains that when the federal reserve allowed goldman and morgan stanleybut not lehman brothersto become bank holding companies on sept   goldman was able three days later to raise  billion in equity  billion from the public and another  billion from investor warren buffett that would probably not have happened without the feds expedited decision and support a week later morgan stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a  billion equity investment from mitsubishi ufj financial group 
all told the clinton friendly investment giant goldman sachs after making record profits became the fifth megabank ordered to pay billions to the department of justice after the financial crash of  in addition the firm was ordered to pay  billion to the federal housing finance agency in   not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the great recession 
in a new york review article goldman sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in  
data gathered mostly from the corporate research project  a public interest website show that on thirteen occasions between  and  goldman was penalized by us courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between  and

wall street selects team clinton 
the clinton connection to goldman sachs emerged in the early s as robert rubin  a former senior partner with goldman with a year tenure with the firm joined former president clintons economic policy team later becoming secretary of the treasury in  around that time the clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the rubinomics banner aka clintonomics the plan raised taxes on most americans specifically the middle class  in what was said to be the largest increase in american history at the time 
according to congressional record  vol part   in  the economy grew at a sickly   clintons vetoes of spending cuts insured continued deficits well into the st century 
in a multinational monitor report entitled wall streets best investment ten deregulatory steps to financial meltdown by robert weissman and james donahue  a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the s under the clinton administration was revealed 
during the clinton administration treasury secretary robert rubin who had run goldman sachs enthusiastically promoted the legislation in a  testimony before the house banking committee for example rubin argued that the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago let alone in   us banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically even domestically the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by glasssteagall has eroded significantly 
with a pedigree that included goldman sachs the council on foreign relations cfr the brookings institution and the bilderberg group  robert rubin emerged in  as the vice chairman at citigroup  after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of glasssteagall while serving as secretary of treasury rubin made a fortune with citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the  crash heres a passage from bloomberg regarding rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse 
when it collapsed due in part to bankfriendly policies that rubin advocated he made more than  million while others lost everything you have to view people in a fair light says phil angelides cochair of the financial crisis inquiry commission who credits rubin for much of the clintonera prosperity but on the other side of the ledger are key acts such as the deregulation of derivatives or stopping the commodities futures trading commission from regulating derivatives that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster 
sworn fbi director james comey sworn in by former doj head eric holder image source thewhitehousespin  
under the microscope 
over the summer wire observed some curious connections between the clinton foundation and fbi director james comey  as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the clinton family heres the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the clinton investigation 
many will also be unaware that before comey was installed by the obama administration as fbi director he was on the board of director at hsbc bank  a bank implicated in international money laundering  including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels forbes also points out where comey was also at the key chokepoint during the case involving dodgy auditor kpmg which followed on by the hsbc criminal case 
if comey and his boss attorney general alberto gonzalez had made a different decision about kpmg back in  kpmg would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts hsbc and standard chartered scbff  were committing on its watch bloomberg reported in  that back in june of  comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether kpmg would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations 
in  the guardian discussed the financial relationship between hsbc and the clinton foundation receiving a startling  million in donations from clients of the large bank 
the charitable foundation run by hillary clinton and her family has received as much as m from wealthy international donors who were clients of hsbcs controversial swiss bank 
leaked files from hsbcs swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation with accounts in geneva 
a new update on the fbi investigation into the clinton foundation was announced over the last  hours in addition the recently reopened clinton email probe from last week it remains to be seen how indepth this new investigation will be 
to call it collusion would be an understatement when looking back at the financial affairs of the clintons goldman sachs and others on wall street  its clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate

EdJenner,2016-11-06T04:10:18.147+02:00,clinton emails use arab female agitators to shame israel," stupid things voxcoms matthew yglesias has said by aaron bandler october   
matt yglesias of vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder given his penchant for saying things that are mindbogglingly asinine apparently yglesias agrees with this sentiment matt yglesias deleted something like  tweets yesterday clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations 
fortunately the internet is forever and all of the stupid things that yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly 
here are  things yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb 
 yglesias was convinced that people would love obamacare that is until he didnt  mattyglesias obamacare marker  which was solid as of  minutes ago  appears to no longer be markering pictwittercomaeyximig  omri ceren cerenomri october   
his  piece is still available though and in it he whines about how supposedly the media for nonideological reasons is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when obamacare becomes the status quo people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten 
in other words yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking that all fell by the wayside when the obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of  percent 
 yglesias made a racist comment toward former louisiana gov bobby jindal r in a  tweet that is now deleted yglesias wrote is bobby jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping 
yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash tweeting oh fun conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode 
eventually yglesias backed down tweeting for the record now that i know more about jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff 
the irony of yglesias saying this was not lost on twitter good thing you dont say dumb stuff mt mattyglesias its clear that jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff  jon gabriel exjon june   
 yglesias once ranted against dumb jewish politicians the leftist pundit wrote a thinkprogress piece in  that was seriously titled dumb jewish politicians in which yglesias highlighted a passage from jonathan chait who wrote in the new republic that thensen joe lieberman ict had to be stupid for not supporting the public option 
i suspect that lieberman is the beneficiary or possibly the victim of a cultural stereotype that jews are smart and good with numbers chait wrote trust me its not true if senator smith from idaho was angering democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes most liberals would deride him as an idiot with lieberman we all suspect its part of a plan i think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn 
yglesias agreed 
ive long held a related theory about eric cantor 
anyways this reminds me that at a meeting this morning i pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret christmas morning session that only jewish senators would attend theres a whole bunch??boxer cardin feingold feinstein franken kohl lautenberg levin lieberman sanders schumer specter and wyden its a very progressive bunch and lieberman could easily be outvoted 
 yglesias advocated for ending time zones seriously in what was a typical example of vox being a waste of space yglesias wrote a  piece titled the case against time zones theyre impractical  outdated yglesias pontificated 
northern idaho is connected via i to spokane and seattle to its west but not to boise to its south so the couer dalene area is on pacific time rather than mountain time india has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time 
yet while these zigzags and minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time they serve a very practical purpose it is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings calls and other arrangements across time zones the need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag commuting across time zones would be more annoying still which is why the suburbs of chicago that are located in indiana use illinois central time rather than indianapolis eastern time 
but the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations its to shift the world to one giant time zone 
ygleasias then called for one time to rule them alla phrase that prompted jrr tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy 
if the whole world used a single gmtbased time schedules would still vary in general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out so at  most of london would be at home or in bed and most of los angeles would be at the office but of course londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in la would be grabbing a nap the difference from today is that if you were putting together a londonla conference call at  thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal a flight that leaves new york at  and lands in paris at  is a sixhour flight with no need to keep track of time zones if your appointment is in el paso at  you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of texas 
pejman yousefzadeh explained just how stupid yglesiass time zone piece was writing at ricochet  i grant you that there are times when confusion does take place but seriously who cares is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that matthew yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them dont the people at vox have anything better to write about 
apparently they dont 
 yglesias doesnt understand floridas geography very well yglesias wrote a short blurb in the atlantic in  in which he began thinking aloud about the city of miami 
id been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know yglesias said 
people immediately pointed the obvious answer miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is the everglades national parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish 
yes yes commenters i know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in florida  hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes an exasperated yglesias wrote in an update 
except that the land is not exswampland its an actual swamp  maybe yglesias shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud 
 yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fineif youre a politician yglesias found himself getting smacked around on twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government 
for better or for worse thats politics yglesias wrote at thinkprogress  
on twitter yglesias attempted to justify it by writing fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do yes 
and yet yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist eli lake of being dishonest on twitter 
yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a catch when he told the daily caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the twitter incident 
 yglesias once hailed the department of veteran affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate the federalist s sean davis pointed to yglesias writing in  that the va was producing the highest quality care in the country their turnaround points the way toward solving americas healthcare crisis yglesias also tweeted at gop chairman reince priebus in  will reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans this tweet was also deleted and for good reason since the va has caused  veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency 
 yglesias doesnt understand the purpose of the senate yglesias wrote the following for thinkprogress in  per the guardian  
if you add together the two republican senators from wyoming with the one from alaska one from south dakota one from new hampshire two from maine two from idaho two from nebraska one from nevada two from utah two from kansas two from mississippi one from iowa two from oklahoma two from kentucky one from louisiana two from south carolina and two from alabama the  of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator  percent of the american population meanwhile barbara boxer and dianne feinstein together represent  percent of the american population 
now of course texas is also a big state though at  percent of the population its a lot smaller than california and there are small states like vermont and north dakota that have two democratic senators so the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one though the wacky apportionment of the senate does have a partisan valence the point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things if you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population we have just  senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain  percent of the population the other  senators represent about  percent of the people if the iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them 
in three paragraphs of rambling incoherent nonsense yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations 
 yglesias doesnt understand americas financial system yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a  slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country as there were  at the time yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous 
 they are poorly managed you know how the best and brightest of wall street royally screw up sometimes this doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys it gets worse and since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from fdicensured depositors nobody is watching the store in effect the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones the dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on wall streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems  they cant be regulated since these banks are so small they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs so since american public policy is perversely committed to preserving them small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations and once the carveouts exist they create pressure for extension further up the food chain other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation  they cant compete if you want the jpmorgan chases and bank of americas of the world to be held to account you need both regulation and competition but a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition having a large share of americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance 
davis debunked yglesiass argument which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in  
yglesias arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks you guys the wall street banks that nearly destroyed america arent the problem small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem dont worry about the facts just go with it davis wrote in the federalist  im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation 
 yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon after reading a review of a booker t washington biography yglesias started thinking about black conservative political tradition prompting him to write in a  thinkprogress post its only extremely recently that the idea of an africanamerican aligning himself à la clarence thomas with the mainstream conservative movement in america could be remotely possible but even so that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist 
this is patently false as damon root explained in reason  
actually the great harlem renaissance author and journalist george schuylerwho was known as the black hl menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before clarence thomas came on the scene including schuylers unambiguously titled  autobiography black and conservative and the celebrated novelist and folklorist zora neale hurston both endorsed conservative sen robert a taft in the  presidential election and repeatedly attacked fdrs new deal 
 yglesias expressed joy when andrew breitbart died following breitbarts death yglesias tweeted  conventions around dead people are ridiculous the world outlook is slightly improved with andrewbrietbart sic dead 
this tweet has also been deleted and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid its ghoulish vile and reprehensible and slate defended yglesias stating that he is a very passionate journalist and slate values that passion

Dr. Majid Rafizadeh,2016-10-27T09:20:34.163+03:00,weird bans on women in iran,"bill clinton inc billions for the foundation  million for the clintons october   
call it the unintended revenge of doug band 
band used to be bills huma the guy that the big guy couldnt go to the bathroom without let alone perform the simplest tasks the clinton foundation was a band project the waters grew murkier but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating doug band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running bill clinton inc 
and band was also organizing personal income directly for clinton under the heading forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc band wrote we have dedicated our selves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
band mentions four such arrangements without naming them bill clinton was paid nearly  million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college laureate international universities according to reports and the familys tax returns a dubaibased firm gems education paid bill clinton more than  in  according to the tax returns band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the clintons including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from ubs ericsson bhp and barclays in  alone according to the clintons tax returns bill clinton earned  in speaking fees 
of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between dougs teneo interests and the entire clintonworld octopus 
we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities band wrote he also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation 
bands memo provided data showing how much money each of teneos  clients at the time had given to the clinton foundation how much they had paid bill clinton and in some cases how he or kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments 
band wrote that teneo partners had raised in excess of  million for the foundation and  million in paid speaking fees for bill clinton he said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out  million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place 
band also described how kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with ubs global wealth management introducing bill clinton to a top executive at a  charity dinner in the ensuing years ubs upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a teneo client and agreed to pay bill clinton for speeches band wrote 
band was actually making the case that the entire network of the clinton foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the clintons not to mention the interests of people around them 
banks and major corporations were doing business with bills toady paying bill money and donating to the clinton foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part 
band described in the memo how he combined his work for cgi and teneo he wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the  cgi gathering to meet with teneo clients he also acknowledged giving free cgi memberships to target teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors memberships generally cost  a year 
teneo meanwhile named bill clinton its honorary chairman clinton had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to teneo regarding geopolitical economic and social trends according to a separate june  memo that band wrote to the state department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment 
bill clinton was initially paid  million by teneo according to man of the world a book written with the former presidents participation by author joe conason 
and heres where it gets appropriately entertaining 
but band outlined that kelly his teneo cofounder had served simultaneously between  and  as an unpaid economic envoy to northern ireland appointed by thensecretary of state hillary clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included coke ubs and dow band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with kellys state department ethics agreement 
kellys multiple roles came together during one state department event in  when thensecretary clinton recognized dow among other companies for creating jobs in northern ireland and thanked kelly for his work on the issue 
dow became one of teneos first major clients according to bands memo dow chief executive andrew liveris had been introduced to bill clinton over a round of golf with kelly in august  
thats not consistent with mafia ethics agreements but its all good in clintonworld",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/hillary-hijab_3.jpg?itok=hUc_tXHO,hate,1.0,obama used religious test

Jason Easley,2016-10-26T23:38:10.835+03:00,clinton isnt letting up as she hammers trump for pimping his hotel instead of campaigning,"a pollster who is in the field in two swing states is reporting that he is seeing no early impact from the fbi reviewing new emails in the hillary clinton investigation in two swing states 
geoff garin of hart research tweeted from the field still early but i was in the field in two states last night and saw absolutely no impact from the reporting on the comey letter 
 geoff garin geoffgarin october   
it is still early but if this were the election shifting news that republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate the reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign it will be because republicans are coming back to trump 
there are few undecided voters in this election and even if all the republican base come home to trump it wont be enough for trump to win because he is losing where the presidential election is really held trump is getting crushed at the state level 
republicans have been trying to build hillary clintons emails into a story for years and they have failed at every turn 
hillary clinton led the election while under congressional investigation hillary clinton led the election while under fbi investigation hillary clinton is leading the election today the message that republicans and the media dont want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails and they dont care 
voters are smarter than republicans and the press give them credit for the hillary clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that clinton did anything wrong 
if the polls tighten a little this will be the best news in the world for hillary clinton and democrats because it will destroy any potential for democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls

Alex Ansary,2016-11-05T00:33:12.210+02:00,bill clinton and hillary lolita express pedophilia ring,"opinion hillary is the whore of babylon and is not human  
tracy twyman 
i put some of this information in an article i published yesterday morning about a larger subject today i have decided to isolate these segments and add more for a comprehensive piece on the subject because other relevant information has emerged 
people in the fbi think hillary clinton is the antichrist  they are close she is the whore of babylon 
hillary was born in  supposedly i looked for this information on a hunch after noticing several clues and sure enough back in  someone on david ickes forum speculated that hillary may have been the moonchild that according to artist marjorie cameron  was implanted into her own womb by rocket scientist occultist and crowley associate jack parsons during a ritual called the  babalon working  the purpose was to birth a child to be an incarnation of what crowley called  babalon  the scarlet whore with the cup of blood foretold in st johns revelation that rides the beast 
cameron actually claimed that this fetus after being taken from her womb was delivered to people involved in the militarys nuclear weapons progranm who were apparently in cahoots with parsons and placed inside of a nuclear bomb that was tested but the fetus survived she said because it had been placed inside of a special canister made exactly for this purpose for the  trinity bomb test they made a special canister called jumbo that was supposed to to preserve the plutonium if the bomb did failed to go off they reportedly didnt end up using it for that but it has been suggested that this is what preserved the fetus of the moonchild presumably it grew up to be somebody 
crowley named one of his female consorts who he always called his scarlet women hilarion her name was jeanne foster crowleys attempt to conceive an heir as a magical child with hilarion resulted supposedly in the childs spirit being attached to his protege charles stanfield jones back in  the attachment allegedly occurred when jones went through the ritual for crossing the abyss in the th degree of the oto which involves being ritually sodomized by everyone in the group 
jack parsons another person who had willingly subjected himself to this ritual channeled the book of the antichrist in  where he foretold 
and within seven years of this time babalon the scarlet woman hilarion will manifest among ye and bring this my work to its fruition 
i also believe that hillary with her notorious cracking voice and possibly her rival trump were foretold in another document channeled by parsons the book of babalon  
her voice is sure as the judgement trump to crack the house of wrong though walls are high and stone is hard and the rule of hell was long the gates shall fall and the irons break in the birth of babalon 
in rome the hilaria was a festival to the goddess cybele worshipped in the form of a black meteorite stone to celebrate the resurrection of her son who as the legend states she had been having sex with she then became jealous of his love of others castrated him and let him die of bleeding the reason why all of her priests the galli were castrated and actually considered women she later regretted this and caused him to be brought back to life then forced everyone under her rule to celebrate by laughing and partying joyously as commemorated in this festival consider this next time you notice hillary clinton laughing inappropriately 
also note that hillary clinton has made several selfdepricating jokes about herself being  not even human  and shortcircuiting when she gets herself twisted up in her own lies specifically in october  when her interviewer at buzzfeed noted that she seemed to not be sweating even though it was a hot day odd because hillary has notoriously bad bo she asked hillary what kind of deodorant she used clintons reply was astounding

David G. Brown,2016-10-31T00:38:02.802+02:00,airbnb goes full sjw and demands users host deviants of every kind in their home,"as i have repeatedly shown in my articles i am a fan of all aspects of fitnessnot just strength and developing muscular mass but also cardiovascular endurance and flexibility as well you likely knew this already
you are also likely aware that i have done several articles on stretching most recently the relax into stretch technique that i state can be used predominantly for lower body stretching such as the splits which are and will likely always be considered the benchmark of hip and leg flexibility
but what about upper body flexibility most people dont focus on that and that is just as important to train as lower body flexibility namely for purposes of increased athletic performance reduction of joint aches and pains and in some cases increased strength i have taught the readers some basic upper body stretches in the past such as the chest stretch and the door frame stretch but in my opinion if youre going to do any one stretch for upper body flexibility that would have to be the seated twist stretch
how it works this stretch involves crossing your legs in a manner that will be discussed below and twisting the torso while simultaneously locking your arm onto your bent knees this stretch will hit most of your most prominent upper body musclesthe latissimus dorsi the triceps the deltoids the obliques the neck and the pectorals
in addition to those visible muscles the twist stretch will work the deep spinal muscles  and even the muscles of the buttocks the gluteus maximus medius and minimus as well
many athletes perform the twist stretch particularly combat athletes such as wrestlers judokas and mixed martial artists that need great torso flexibility to escape from holds and pinfalls
sounds like something you ought to learn doesnt it but how

as i have happily admitted in the past and will likely do so again paul wades outstanding convict conditioning series has taught me this and many other exercises and i cannot advocate wades writing enough more specifically the twist stretch comes from convict conditioning   the first book deals with the core calisthenic seriespushups squats and the like i have already gone over these in detail in contrast the second book deals with static holds that develop strength and flexibility such as the lsit and todays topic
while the third book deals with explosive movements such as the back and front handsprings that will be a topic for another time instead lets go into the steps of the twist stretch
all of the pictures here are taken directly from the book
the exercises the first twist stretch is the easy twist stretch sit down on the floor with your feet extended take one foot and put it inside the other leg resting that foot next to the opposite knee as shown
now twist your body so the opposite shoulder turns towards the raised kneed ie if the left knee is raised turn the right shoulder and vice versa keep the foot flat on the ground and the knee stationaryjust twist the torso allow your neck to turn as it naturally wants to turn

then lock your torso by placing your elbow against the opposite side of the knee while holding your body up with the other hand
you should immediately begin to feel a stretch all around your torso
hold the stretch for  seconds for each side when this is comfortable for you move on
step  is the simple twist stretch which requires a little bit more flexibility place one foot over the other leg as shown above then take the foot that is not flat on the ground bend the leg back and touch the heel of that foot to the opposing buttock ie the right heel touches the left buttock

this foot position will be used for all twist stretches from henceforth
now as before rotate your torso towards the opposite knee right shoulder to left knee and vice versa locking yourself by placing your elbow on the opposite side of the knee and again supporting your body with the other hand hold for  seconds and move on
stretch  is where things become more difficult assume the position from stretch  but this time you will have to rotate the torso with much more force as the goal of this stretch is to extend your arm and touch the instep of the foot that is flat on the floor your arm wont be able to stretch on its own and i dont advise you try you will have to accomplish this with proper torso rotation

stretch  has the difficulty increase further get a hand towel or some other object that is about a foot long assume the stretching position and rotate the torso while holding said towel remove the supporting hand from the floor and flick the towel through the hole made by your raised leg obviously your hand is not extending down to your instep here wrapping the support hand around your back grab the other end of the towel this begins the stretch

each time you stretch you will assume this position holding the towel in two hands you will work your hands up and down the towel slowly bringing your hands together by gripping greater portions of the towel eventually you will be able to clasp fingers and that is the final level of the twist stretch

this process will be slow and arduouscoach wade himself admits that it took him the better part of a year to accomplish this by moving his fingers together inch by inch i myself am not quite at the final level yeta rough measurement shows that i have about  more inches of towel to go before my fingers touch but i have certainly noticed increased mobility and flexibility already
the towel stretch can be made easier by remembering to worm both hands up the towel not just one actively use both to secure deeper stretches and you will notice progress
doing even the easiest variations of this stretch will make you notice an immediate healing of the spine your back will deliciously crack and youll feel warm and limber afterwards and with practicing the more advanced variants you will make yourself more limber for whatever physical activity you engage in ranging from dancing to getting out of submission holds
or you could be one of millions of americans with bad backs and hips the choice is yours

amazing now that is how you rally on election day 
like so many americans candice spent her morning lying in her bed kicking herself for not having voted early but as soon as it seemed like shed go back to sleep her fallopian tubes shot out of her abdomen curled themselves around the side of her bed and threw her to the floor after dragging her body to her living room her helpful ovaries crawled up to the doorknob and jostled the front door open what started out as a lazy morning ended with her ovaries anchoring themselves to the floor and pulling the rest of her body to a polling place at nearby jefferson public school where she dutifully filled out her ballot for president of the united states

Beau Albrecht,2016-11-04T19:07:09.707+02:00,is western civilization worth saving,"with her hollywood and silver screen career options all but dried up former charmed actress and constantly nearnaked attentionseeker rose mcgowan is now a leading feminist as you would expect this transition occurred after her looks which never approached those of costar alyssa milano had well and truly begun to fade mcgowan is not alone in making this spectacular shift pamela anderson and professional sjw natasha devon are among a growing crowd of women who rail against sexism and objectification after years of trying often very successfully to sexualize their youth
seeking to cash in on her newfound fame as an unhinged sjw rose mcgowan launched the rose army a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against domestic violence and female objectification full sjw mode is just a button away for her for instance she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity claimed an xmen movie poster promoted violence against women 
so now comes the task of reconciling the new rose mcgowan with the old one whose selfobjectification is best described by this infamous photo with exboyfriend marilyn manson

excuses excuses rose mcgowan has tried to gloss over her past history of selfobjectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy
mcgowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds such as with a fellow charmed actress shannen doherty on patriarchy sexism and female objectification  sadly this very public attentionseeking in which mcgowan wrote doherty an open letter comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer  but you know a girls gotta attentionwhore including when another girl she used to have catfights with is about to die
rose mcgowan has a lot in common with pamela anderson ex playboy cover model anderson after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship has now come out against pornography  she may not be bad for a gal nearing  but her best years are a good  years behind her i would wager that pamela anderson hit  and spent the last several years in denial before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her pornography addictions are bad but anderson showing these new colors in  is nothing short of a joke
andersons position can be summed up by the following two pictures
time when she did not condemn pornography 

time when she condemns pornography 

previously a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists these activists are nominally against the sexualization of women but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females whilst there is a lot of truth to this it only tells part of the story the rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle and what better time to turn on these industries whether they be the pornography film or modeling markets than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them
this phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization  attractive tennis players like sabine lisicki and unattractive ones like serena williams have made careers out of wearing revealing oncourt clothing which is much more for show than practicality but when the chance presents itself lisicki and others have moaned like at this years wimbledon  about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet but they pick and choose when objectification is bad just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them
its not just famous people natasha devon
many return of kings readers will remember natasha devon from her awful performance against milo yiannopoulos during a british sky news debate on fashion mannequins there seems to have been an eerie timing in devons transition from selfdescribed former model to sjw she founded a socalled body image education program in  in her midtwenties i dont know about you but this seems to be the sort of age when nonfamous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger fresher girls
as she hurtled towards  natasha devon penned an article for cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia which morphed into a regular monthly column then came the selfesteem team devon created in  frequently with government funding the selfesteem team has essentially applauded obesity britains number one health crisis and sought to reengineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive
devon along with anderson and mcgowan may chalk an antiobjectification epiphany down to age experience or something similarly convenient but the changes happened neither at the height of their selfsexualization careers nor during the prewall protracted slide always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general sjw activism
when a woman complains about the objectification of women it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls or c her goods are well and truly gone there is a delicious irony to option c as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a halfdecade of alcohol or drugfueled benderstakes them away
feminism as projection 
it is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs of anyone roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and return of kings say
we need to turn this idea of projection against feminists even more than we have before modernday feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh uncertain world for women whose looks are now washedup feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to
rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant

USA Today,2016-10-26T23:45:15.782+03:00,california national guard members wont have to pay back bonuses,"will china trigger the next global recession current debt level causes grave concern jing jin  misesorg   
chinas debt growth rate has become the focus of some discussions and fair enough from comparing the outright levels it may seem that china can collapse at any moment 
daniel fernandez suggested this in his article  has china reached its debt limit  in mises wire  in response to the governments monetary expansion stimulus plan after the  financial crisis chinas corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector however in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective using the same data source as used by fernandez we find that chinas total debt as a percentage of gdp was  percent by the end of  debttogdp ratio of corporate government and household sectors stood at  percent  percent and  percent respectively 
for government and household sectors both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a fourtrillion yuan rmb stimulus plan in  government debttogdp ratio which was kept in the mid s in the first decade of this millennium now stood at  percent by the end of  households debttogdp ratio was at  percent in  and almost doubled to  percent in  and then doubled again to  percent by the end of  the leveraging up of households happened exactly as the chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its  stimulus 
apart from the demand for urban housing chinese households with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation furthermore as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending household debt increased dramatically however we must note that although the debt growth rate was high the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers 
the most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector with the debttogdp ratio increased from approximately  percent prior to  to  percent by the end of  first of all the level of corporate debt mostly in the form of bank loans was high to start with but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector whose funding source is mostly deposits two figures from jonathan andersons how to think about china series provide some insights  
an international comparison of assets of banking system vs domestic saving rate 
breakdown of assets of chinas financial system 
this point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures for example between the us and china obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in china whereas in the us the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily 
financial asset structure us vs china  
data source the world bank federal reserve bank shanghai stock exchange shenzhen stock exchange china central deposit and clearing co ltd ccdc sifma 
it is therefore not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to governments stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system chinas flat yield curve 
the large role of the banks can also be seen in chinas bond market yields and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve  the reason for this is simple deposits when banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields this investment strategy or assetliability management scheme bids up the bond prices on the long end hence pushing down the longterm yields 
in addition between allocating deposits to these two types of assets bonds vs loans banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds rather than lending due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand credit risks market liquidity and yields that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early  so the yield spread at current stage reflects more of the combination of chinas financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals as the government flooded the market with four trillion rmb from the stimulus plan in  bond yields faced downward pressure more so at the longterm end please see the yields of chinese government treasury bonds at maturity  years vs  year and the spread thereof in the below figure wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of bankingsector supervision in form of trusts for example but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner 
data source wind ccdc 
china didnt open up to the outside world until the very late s now china provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around  percent obviously a good part of chinas production structure has been configured to export mostly to the developed economies which are dominated by the service sector as the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum china faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers which stands at  times the number of us consumers this reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities but to me this is more of a textbook case of austrian economics at work capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market and this takes time moreover quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than  years ago so that chinese consumers dont have to go to japan to buy hitech toilet lids  a healthier skepticism of stimulus 
needless to say the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue ultimately whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post  stimulus phase is a function of how fast the chinese government runs the money printing press a recent article on the peoples daily  the mouthpiece of china communist party ccp  quoted the diagnosis from an authoritative figure on the chinese economy and its cure this authoritative figure suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate comparing with its own historical average of  percent anyone with an understanding of chinas political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of chinese leadership this can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years 
the xinhua news agency the mainstream media group recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world how chinas policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media in addition a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced and the central government is pushing hard for businessfriendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom 
china has its problems tons of them china may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises as many people say no matter whichever the case i am more convinced that china will be among the first ones to revive  because it has high savings to invest it has a welltrained labor force with one of the most vibrant if not the most complete manufacturing chain and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over  percent of its gdp it is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process it is not yet a welfare state chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises china has the biggest potential market of  billion people with a rising middleclass that is still increasing in numbers and share in population serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the st century

a trump supporter sporting a hillary for prison tshirt chanted jews sa in support of his candidate during a rally in arizona on saturday 
the target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for trumps rhetoric at every rally 
the context while the crowd was chanting usa one man chanted jews sa words like that cant be spun or read into the intent and meaning were obvious to everyone 
watch here on video obtained by the huffington post  
this sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that donald trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction it may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which trump has shown contempt but it is not 
muslims jews immigrants labor taxpayers latinos hispanics mexicans africanamericans women pows veterans people with disabilities gold star families and the military have felt the sting of trumps words and the disdain in his heart 
throughout this campaign season the vitriol against hillary clinton saw no limit signs and tshirts too disgusting to quote in this article chants of lock her up at the republican convention and since trump promised his base of thugs lowlifes and haters he would weaken the first amendment strengthen the second and establish the altright utopia 
hillary clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race she also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar she was competing for who we are and who we could be for all the trump claims that the media is rigged in clintons favor it was trump who got free advertising who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary news stories of the campaign 
there is no doubt that hillary clinton will keep her promise to fight for us she has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign every time hillary clinton called out donald trumps sexist comments she was fighting for all women who were attacked humiliated and sexually abused by men like trump every time clinton shamed trumps horrific and disgusting comments about the khan family she was standing up for every gold star family she was also standing up for every muslimamerican the same is true every time clinton condemned trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to altright stereotypes about africanamericans innercities and africanamerican communities 
every time trump spewed hate in whatever direction hillary clinton defended the target 
so no this isnt about choosing the lesser of two evils like every election this is about choosing our next president more importantly its about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be

the united arab emirates a key saudi ally in its deadly aggression against yemen has welcomed a new united nations peace proposal to end the yemen conflict 
the uae supports the efforts of un special envoy for yemen ismail ould cheikh ahmed knowing that the mission of a mediator is always tough minister of state for foreign affairs anwar gargash said on his twitter account on thursday 
the remarks came two days after the un envoy submitted the plan to yemens houthi ansarullah movement and its allies 
according to informed sources the roadmap urges agreement on naming a new vice president after the withdrawal of houthis from the capital sanaa and other cities and their handover of arms to a third party 
the initiative further calls on former yemeni president abd rabbuh mansur hadi to transfer power to the vice president who would appoint a new premier to form a government united nations special envoy for yemen ismail ould cheikh ahmed speaks to reporters at sanaa airport following his visit to the yemeni capital on october   photo by reuters 
the roadmap represents a political solution for the yemeni crisis gargash said adding un efforts represent a chance to bring yemenis back to the political track other alternatives are gloomy 
the hadi administration however said that it had not received any roadmap for a political settlement 
peace talks which were held between yemens opposing parties in kuwait ended in deadlock in august 
earlier this week ahmed made a visit to sanaa where he held meetings with yemens warring sides and called for a return to a cessation of hostilities to allow aid deliveries 
the riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on yemen on sunday hours after a threeday truce in the conflictridden country expired 
yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by saudi arabia since late march  with the un putting the toll from the aggression at more than  
the offensive was launched to crush the houthi ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former yemeni government 
the houthi ansarullah fighters took state matters in their own hands after the resignation and escape of hadi which threw yemen into a state of uncertainty and threatened a total security breakdown in the country where an alqaeda affiliate is present loading",english,presstv.ir,http://media.presstv.com/photo/20161026/2fe8c091-875f-41ce-a87a-8a4ac2f2ab95.jpg,state,1.0,world leaders personal chefs sample indian market fare,pakistan pakistans cricketer turned politician imran khan c talks journalists outside supreme court islamabad october photo ap police raided youth convention opposition leader imran khans pakistan tehreek insaaf pti party capital islamabad arresting dozens activists ahead planned protest images local news channels showed police uniform beating activists batons leading detained away waiting buses sudden police arrived started arresting people media outlets quoted anila khawaja spokeswoman pti saying several pti leaders lawmakers infuriated police raid government proved democracy pakistan monarchy asad umar pti lawmaker told reporters scene spokesman islamabad district administration said raid enforcing order issued earlier day citys top administrator outlawed gatherings five people thursday raid came hours city order banned public gatherings ahead khans planned protest set begin november islamabad khan former pakistan cricket star turned politician described upcoming mass protest final push force prime minister nawaz sharif resign corruption allegations leader pakistan tehreek insaf pti imran khan waves supporters rally peshawar pakistan august photo afp khan led previous mass protest summer front parliament calling government resign election rigging allegations khan insisted antigovernment protests would continue sharif administration offers appropriate response corruption allegations leaked confidential documents panamanian mossack fonseca law firm showing company helped rich powerful clients across world shady businesses clients reportedly included three sharifs children carried business transactions could judged money laundering tax avoidance leaked records revealed sharifs children hasan hussain maryam owned offshore companies also real estate properties london sharifs family denies wrongdoing people pakistan imran khan helm asking inquiry determine sharifs children made money buy offshore companies real estate londons prime locations whether paid due tax income loading,1.0
KD7ONE,2016-10-26T16:50:00.000+03:00,no title,"whether you are looking to attract a longterm girlfriend or wife or you are experimenting with shorterterm liaisons learning the art of seduction is essential reams of content have been written on the topic both on rok and elsewhere indeed its possible to get lost in a tsunami of pickup advice
but while it can be useful to absorb successful peoples techniques a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself to that end here is a list of the top five habits ive observed in men who are great with women
 they take every opportunity 
guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them in this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs they know that the market is in a constant state of flux and that change is at the heart of opportunity as such like the speculators of pussy they are they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid regardless of the circumstances
game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time i would wholeheartedly endorse this i would also add that however many opportunities youre taking now there are always more to be had i for example will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while im traveling to my office on the subway there are so many cute girls on their way to work in london or any reasonablysized commuter city and yet guys wont talk to them rationalizing that it is too early shell think im crazy or whatever in actual fact ive probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time
so next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances it is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game
 they notice and follow up on iois 
while most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you socalled indicators of interest or iois without you having done anything
while i would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay i would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them and to follow up with alacrity not only do direct iois frequently lead to sex but also if you fail to pursue a potentiallyinterested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards men after all are the more romantic gender there are few more lasting selfinflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated had you had the courage to speak to her
the successful seducer is always on the lookout for iois therefore and hell execute quickly when he gets them even if it means deviating slightly from his routine for example a while back i was on a subway train when i got strong direct eye contact from an attractive petite and very feminine brunettejust my type once youve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid ioi from casual interest but the best way to describe it is as that rabbit in the headlights look that girls give when they are truly smitten
well she was giving me that look and i knew i had to follow up when she got of the train i went right after her introduced myself on the platform took her number and then left a drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later had i not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected
remember always be willing to go after a sure thing and never leave money on the table
 they stand out from the crowd 
every truly successful seducer i have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd this can manifest itself in many ways but primarily im talking about standing out physically in terms of what you wear and standing out in terms of your personality
while the old concept of peacocking is rightly maligned by both men and women these days there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that all else being equal the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacksandsweatshirt counterpart a former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else ive ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession
i appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity what real man takes so much care over his clothes but remember that narcissism is one of the three dark triad characteristics that are like catnip to women along with machiavellianism and psychopathy therefore taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lotif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in
your personality too should be larger than life dont be obnoxious but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group
 they are dominant 
there can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant now of course the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no nevertheless within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance  both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity
the key thing here is to appear decisive and unwaveringeven if secretly you arent for example after youve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date try getting up taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi when she questions what youre doing just say were going back to my place to watch a movie doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her
now in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and thats fine  just do the actions anyway and see what happens shes much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesnt she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet
 they dont apologize 
highly successful seducers never apologizeor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway the fact of the matter is you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs if you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cockyfunny humor then the chances are youre going to offend someone every so often
now im not recommending that you should be a dickbe classy and convivial in all your interactions but the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal valhalla if someone gets offended then make a joke but dont apologize as long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for
remember an apology is a submission to someone elses frameand that is never a good look

  clinton corruption  john podesta  crime family naturalnews its not just that the corruption and criminality of the clintons knows no bounds its also that the democrat political machine trying to thrust her into power also has total disregard for democracy truth and ethics their mission put our nations worst political criminal into the white house by any means necessary including systematic lying fraud money laundering intimidation of opponents and even murder of those who might testify against her the clinton machine is a mafia operation  and every person involved in it must go to jailthat includes not just the deep operatives like podesta lynch and abedin but also all the deep cover clinton operatives pretending to be journalists  including stephanopoulos maddow hayes milbank and all the rest  see the list here  every one of these people has committed crimes of sedition against the united states of america and is guilty of attempting to defraud democracy steal the election and place a mafia criminal into power at the highest level of government through the deliberate pursuit of journalistic malpractice  seditious clinton operatives must be arrested and put behind bars to protect america we the people are beyond the stage of merely wanting to vote you out of power and turn off your broadcast networks its now time to seek your indictment and imprisonment so that you cannot be allowed to harm this society ever againevery operative journalist and coconspirator with the clinton foundation the clinton corruption and the clinton murders must be arrested indicted and if found guilty by a fair trial sent to prison this nation needs to heal itself from the clinton nightmare  and the only way thats going to happen is if the criminal traitors sellouts and corrupt backstabbers are marched away in handcuffs and put behind barsa former fbi official said sunday that bill and hillary clinton are part of a crime family and argued top officials hindered the investigation into hillary clintons private email server while she was secretary of state reports thehillcom  kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liarhe also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private serverthe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that god forbid we put someone like that in the white house he added of clintonkallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureauthe agents are furious with whats going on i know that for a fact he said corrupt proclinton journalists should not be given any quarter in all this much like the propagandists of the third reich they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the american people did you know that hillary clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her clinton foundation if you arent aware of this you need to watch clinton cash immediately  the simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel what america has now come to realize via the wikileaks email dumps  the project veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former fbi agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel from the dnc which actively conspired to sideline bernie sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false smear attacks against donald trump every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt democrat political operatives abide by no laws no ethics and no boundaries they lie cheat and steal their way into power at every election and theyre desperately trying to steal this election tooits not just that the clinton crime family must be taken down you see its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned  there isnt a highlevel operative inside the dnc who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis the coordination and collusion money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists todayevery one of these people needs to be arrested indicted and imprisoned this is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across america aside from their criminality democrats policy ideas just dont work even on policy alone democrats are total failures  none of their ideas or policies actually work look at obamacare with its insurance costs now doubling every  years  with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding this was hailed as an historic solution by obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through congress and the supreme court in reality obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis and i called it that from its inceptiondemocrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail they confiscate money from taxpayers waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up while siphoning off billions for their own salaries bonuses and luxurious lifestyles then if you oppose their complete idiocy they invoke the irs to have you audited or arrested this is amerika today under obama and the clintonsthis racket must end the clintons and all their coconspirators must be sent to prison donald trump is right when he says this is bigger than watergate theres no comparison the crimes of the clintons are a thousand times larger and more damning to democracy than anything richard nixon ever attempted corrupt leftist media still lying every hour in a desperate attempt to defeat trump while all this is happening the corrupt leftist media  washington post new york times msnbc cnn google news yahoo news etc  has long since abandoned any pretense of engaging in journalism and is now allin for the clinton criminal mafiathey have

change the channels or turn off their cable tv altogether who needs politicized espn anyway to seek out more accurate news online from sites like natural news and breitbartcom even the mass censorship

Scott,2016-11-05T09:30:43.598+02:00,russia celebrates a unity day of liberation of moscow from the polish roman papists army in,"after the release of a wikileaks email chain from march  on tuesday in which a top clinton aide admitted president barack obama falsely claimed he did not know about hillary clintons private server use while she was secretary of state white house press secretary josh earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue
what the president said was an entirely factual response earnest said to a group of reporters in los angeles where obama was attending democratic fundraisers
earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the presidents actions as mere conspiracies
 
related stories hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency wikileaks podesta said obamas dont need to be this nice to president bush and first lady wikileaks reveals obama knew about clintons emails clean this up i recognize that some of the presidents critics have attempted to construct some type of conspiracy about the communication between the president and the secretary of state he said
he continued but theyve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny so i guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies
obama himself denied any knowledge of the server telling cbs reporter bill plante in march  just after the server revelations that he learned of the clintons private email server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports
 
several days after the server revelations in march  earnest told the press that obama knew about clintons email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server
he reiterated that position on tuesday
the president did trade emails with secretary clinton not a large number of them earnest said
of course the president had possession of secretary clintons email address but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias however the wikileaks email chain  which earnest referred to as stolen and therefore illegitimate  tells a different story with top clinton aides seemingly in a panic that it could come to light that the president was lying when he said he did not know about clintons private server
looks like potus just said he found out hrc was using her personal email when he saw it in the news clinton spokesman josh schwerin said in a march   email published tuesday by wikileaks
we need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say stategov responded former clinton chief of staff cheryl mills

among the many wikileaks emails that were dumped this summer it was clear that hillary clinton is not as popular as the media would have you believe in fact it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her 
the gateway pundit reported  
shes the astroturfed candidate hillary is sooo unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies 
 biggest scoops from the dncleaks wikileak 
wikileaks released nearly  hacked emails it says are from the accounts of democratic national committee officials on friday 
the emails are devastating for hillary clinton according to at least one hacked email hillary clinton has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online she also pays millennials to show up at her rallies 
hillarys support is all a lie its all astroturfed everything this woman does is all a lie  even her rallies are fabricated 
if attkissons explanation were not enough how about this tweet regarding the mainstream media putting their collective useful idiot heads together to pitch the same propaganda about donald trump  biggest scoops from the dncleaks httpstcovmtiepspkj 
 mike cernovich  cernovich july   
this should have come as no surprise 
if you remember when her campaign kicked off in  i reported on the fact that more than  of her twitter followers were either completely fake or inactive  
additionally when she had her iowa kickoff event a whopping  people showed up  the majority of those were reporters 
hillary clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid antiamerican liberals and even then it looks like shes having to pay them to actually do anything to support her in other words her candidacy is completely contrived

A. Griffee,2016-11-02T07:00:00.000+02:00,dml provides stunning analysis predicts trump will win presidential election,"by dean daniels  november    politics  
in the summer of  before the current presidential race ignited and two weeks before trump announced his candidacy dml gave a compelling speech during his tour in the state of massachusetts in front of an audience at a small town synagogue the awardwinning businessman and conservative commentator laid out the key component that he believed would catapult any presidential candidate above all the others putting americans first 
dml emphasizes during his americans first speech that the number one issue in america is immigration he explains in crystal clear detail how immigration both legal and illegal goes beyond party identification he says its not a democrat or republican issue  its an american issue 
having traveled the country by car exploring the idea of running for president himself dml got a real sense for what concerned americans most therefore he knew before the rest of us that the ideal candidate of  would be someone who has the audacity and the courage to tell the american people he or she will commit to the deportation of illegal immigrants 
remember its not an antiimmigration its an antiillegal immigration and its about being proamerica 
while putting americans first would have been dmls campaign theme had he chosen to run for the highest office in the land this strategy was instead adopted by none other than donald jtrump this is one major reason why dml has supported trump since day one 
trump has done more than proven dml correct trump has proven how powerful the  americans first ideology is during a day and age when progressive politicians like barack obama and hillary clinton are catering to foreign workers and corporate donors at the expense of the american people who are left to rot on the back burner 
watch an excerpt from the speech and then check out dmls electoral map and how he sees trump winning on tuesday

former defense minister of canada paul hellyer has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the state canada on the ceta treaty ceta stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet paul hellyer called the treaty therefore comprehensive trade and takeover agreement with this convention which comes out of the hat of the international bankers  families will obtain control over almost the entire world constitutions of member countries will no longer apply only the will of the  families the elite will apply 
the lawsuit was officially filed on october  of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of parliament through an act of parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign ceta and  or perform without having this treaty first by the parliament through official channels  the solid majority of the ceta articles and their impact encroach on exclusive provincial spheres or forumprotected by the division of powers under the constitution act  
most of the ceta provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the canadian constitutional law  the ceta gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected judiciary in canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in canada without any judicial oversight or jurisdiction of the canadian courts over the disputes and 
ceta removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the canadian legal system and various articles of the ceta violate constitutional enshrined rights in the charter of rights and freedoms  and overrides charter guarantees that ground canadas ability to mount public programs on health education social services and public utilitiesincluding the elimination of subsidies monopolies and state enterprises for public welfare in short the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about those of the canadian constitution and canadian citizens 
various provisions of ceta violated constitutional builtrights enshrined in the document charter of rights and freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health education social services and public funds including the termination of subsidies  monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest in short the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the canadian constitution and its inhabitants 
but this is not all paul hellyer which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to canadians and the rest of the world his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world the international bankers international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only  families 
paul hellyer remembers the canada which was separate from the bankers yet not so long ago until  the canadian government expressed its money itself there was no such thing as inflation poverty and debt canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that europe was liberated from the germans at that time life was good cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do from one day to the issued money creation in  the central banks and money was no longer free within a few years canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes paul hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend this affects every canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education health housing etc can be paid without causing debts paul hellyer does the same as foundation for our money aims but in a turbo version he lets no grass grow does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years paul hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat 
now the video of paul hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this 
dear readers this could be the big break this information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers the same applies we can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people the power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it we want a better and fairer world then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for 
privatized money is the reason for all wars privatized money is the cause of poverty oppression exploitation neglect of our elderly and less fortunate privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet now is the chance to get out from under the yoke to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over  years with one goal to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer

politicians are telling trump to knock off such talk but as usual trumps shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum  in which the opposition party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of democratic pressure  is winning the daynone other than billionaire investor and longtime democratic supporter george soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election in favor of clinton  no matter how much of the popular vote and from which battleground states trump capturesas reported by top right news and other outlets during a recent interview with bloomberg news  soros  a democrat megadonor  openly admitted that trump will win the popular vote in a landslidehowever he said that none of that would matter because a president hillary clinton is already a done dealin the interview which is now going viral soros says with certainty that trump will take the popular vote despite what the polls say now which are completely rigged to oversample democrats  but not the electoral college which will go to clintonwhen the reporter asks if that is already a done deal  that clinton will be our next president no matter what  soros says yes and nods his headis soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence or does he truly know something most of us dont knowin a recent column  natural news founder and editor mike adams the health ranger says that soros and democrats have bribed electoral college representatives in a bid to fix the election outcome in favor of clinton in truth that would be the only way it could be done short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting as some reports have already claimed adams further pointed out that soros was one of the main money men behind the black lives matter movement which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country  some of which has led to the deaths of several officers alreadysoros also funds leftwing websites and groups that locate pay and deploy volunteer agitators at trump rallies to start fights and engage in physical violence against trump supporters acts that the establishment media then blames on trump but arent electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that electors district no theyre not ninenine percent of electors have done what theyre supposed to do throughout our history but this is no ordinary election per archivesgov  there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote rather these pledges fall into two categories state law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political partiesin the past the us supreme court has ruled that the constitution doesnt require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and therefore respective political parties may extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties nominees archivesgov notes some state laws hold that faithless electors could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot and could then be replaced by a substitute electorthe supreme court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the constitution no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged said archivesgovthe site notes that throughout our history  percent of electors have voted as required but this is no ordinary time and its no ordinary election  and democrats and the establishment media have already proven that they will do anything to stop a trump presidency plus establishment republicans dont want trump either so you can bet they wouldnt balk at or challenge the

my father was a highranking student radical poobah and still thinks castro is the bees knees although this makes me technically a red diaper baby i rejected all that baloney early on these days i write stories  mostly comedy science fiction  as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice political commentary and my writing projects november   politics 
by  its predicted the usa will no longer have a white majority which in  was  for this we can thank ted kennedys immigration and nationality act of  which the politicians swore up and down wouldnt change the american ethnic composition in europe due to declining native birth rates and mass immigration  this will eventually come to pass for several other nations later this century all according to the coudenhovekalergi plan  the leftists with their really big hearts  think all this will be wonderful 
globalism and cultural marxism are the driving forces behind population replacement policies but unawareness and apathy are almost as much of a problem  some think that if western civilization will go down the toilet they should just go with the flow and enjoy the ride all the way down the tubes thanks to media propaganda and educational indoctrination they have no idea that their own civilization is worth anything and dont have the slightest concern for their own posterity still theyre pretty naive to believe that things cant turn far worse within their own lifetimes why this is bad for those who need reminding in the future is this going to get better or worse 
if trends continue unabated the founding peoples will lose control over their destiny history shows that when this happens the results are not good pillaging and plundering is a more genteel affair in modern times though not always  but youre still not going to like it will your new rulers say since things have changed so much how about we abolish affirmative action and setasides to show weve transcended race dont count on it more likely theyll double down on these preferential treatment programs and come up with new ones and you will have no chance to block the spoils systems 
thats just the beginning too the  diversification  of cities for the last several decades has been baddetroit need i say moreand riots really are getting out of hand now imagine what it will be like when you have no hope of influencing things like section  housing moving into your neighborhood or if youll get any real police protection 
this is what were facing if the aztlán crowd takes over the southwest the community agitators get in charge of the big cities and together their constituency has an electoral majority controlling the federal government also remember that theyve been told since the s that youre evil oppressors responsible for all their problems parts of flyover country might be able to hold out for a while but nothing short of forming their own country will stop the advance of progress if it were ever to come to secession theyll be surrounded outnumbered and outgunned lets keep things from getting to that point is there any hope refugees have taken on the characteristics of invaders 
ive painted a grim picture but i have to be realistic as for what will happen later things only look worse jean raspails camp of the saints describes a bleak future like that this isnt just the usa on the line but western europe too and perhaps eastern europe and australia in time if we want to keep from disappearing into the endless night the time to act is now 
sometimes with luck sovereignty can be regained for example the spanish reconquista or the nations of the balkans rising after a few centuries under the turkish yoke however the results arent guaranteed some nations may never recover in these examples the dhimmis were subjugated under military occupation but they were not outnumbered in their own lands the founding populations must not allow themselves to be dispossessed in their own countries in the first place 
granted the dark forces of globalism are very powerfuland theyd like us to think theyre invinciblebut they must be stopped they also want you to think theyre smarter than you and know whats good for you  if theyd simply focus on getting richer and cease their social engineering theyd have far less to answer for not only has our political establishment failed us theyre working against the public  it wont be easy but we must reassert control over our destiny do we deserve to be dispossessed brainwashed sjws welcoming their own destruction 
some will even sayoften with haughty condescensionthat if we lose our countries then we deserve this fate ignoring for a moment the sheer snottiness as well as the might makes right argument incongruent with the usual rhetoric of fairness by the prepare to be assimilated resistance is futile crowd lets consider the following facts in the s a communist propaganda campaign was launched in the western world in the s this mutated into cultural marxism and kicked into high gear during the s most people have no idea of the scope of it all or where things like political correctness came from only senior citizens remember what it was like living in a fairly normal country even fewer never grew up exposed to this propaganda in one form or another the rest of us have been indoctrinated from an early age by the mass media and educational establishment the western political tradition lately is about openness and democracy for this reason we dont conduct political change by torches and pitchforks these days we play fair even if our enemies often dont  further political correctness encourages the disadvantaged to have solidarity but vilifies the same in the majority this is one reason why were on the defensive and for now usually losing most people only have a vague idea about the extent of managed democracy and sheer corruption those against population replacement policies mostly put their faith in the mainstream opposition parties not realizing that theyve sold out to deeppockets globalists too mainstream conservatism is a controlled opposition  providing token resistance at best 
so with that extent of treachery disinformation limited options for resistance and managed democracy its grotesquely dishonest for the defeatists to tell us that were losing a fair fight as for their opinion that we should just give up i have one word no 
whenever you hear the defeatists crowing that this is inevitable or that we deserve it remember that they want to demoralize you and anyone else listening the same goes for when they tell you that loving your people and wanting your posterity to survive is hatred suppose someone is losing his home by a devious swindle orchestrated by crooks widely lauded for their fairness caring and honesty it would be the height of arrogance to tell the defrauded that he deserved it and should shut up about it and let it happen the depopulation and population replacement agenda first the eu has to accept at least a million asylumseekers annually for the foreseeable future the eu should provide  euros  per asylumseeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing healthcare and education costsand to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states 
dont be fooled this isnt happening because some vague invisible force called progress is pushing things inevitably in this direction no its being actively promoted by globalist interests that have adopted cultural marxism as a means of control 
why are native fertility rates declining below replacement level the major factors are women are encouraged to spend their s partying and their s trying to get rich in a cube farm encouraging them to to make starting a family last priority often leaves them very unhappy over the long term and many will miss the chance to begin good economy tends to be positively correlated with higher fertility rates during recessions births go down the implications are obvious if less tax money was taken from working citizens for costly social services programs and spitinyoureye wars then theyd be able to afford more children sending the guilty to prison instead of bailing them out when they crash the economy might be a good indirect measure too about a third of american babies conceived end up aborted  thanks feminism the same leftists who think this is wonderful will scream bloody murder whenever a savage killer on death row is executed but all thats another matter 
because of declining fertility rates the globalists tell us that we must open the floodgates of third world immigration to prop up the population and support the aging citizens so theyve fed us poison and to soothe the symptoms they want to feed us another kind of poison to hell with that 
granted keeping social security going in the usa will be a challenge still its pretty uncertain that newlyarriving immigrantsif they become the majoritywill be able or willing to support millions of elderly gringos as for future european retirees will they be well cared for by refugees from africa and the middle east the way things are now many of them prefer rioting  looting and collecting welfare over working so these are going to be the people propping up the european retirement programs 
dispossession is inevitable only if we let it happen for now we must educate the rest of the public about whats going on and convince them that their future is worth saving and their posterity is worth preserving once weve achieved critical mass we can confront the political establishment and get the government to start working for us rather than against us whats in it for us whenever someone writes that western civilization is nothing but injustice and oppression theyre using technology we invented to complain about us 
its fashionableespecially in academiato bash western civilization were not perfect but nobody else is either the truth is that were a creative dynamic and industrious people some of us are under the impression that we dont have any culture only other people do but thats mistaken i could spend all day listing our major artists composers poets philosophers writers theologians and the like but i only would scratch the surface 
other cultures have made notable contributionsparticularly east asia and the middle eastbut the fact is that the majority of science and technology that makes life comfortable today originated in the western world electricity motorized transportation refrigeration telecommunications computers need i go on yep that was us we shared our medical advances with the rest of the world increasing longevity and quality of life around the globe whether the worlds future looks more like star trek or more like blade runner may have a lot to do with whether or not our people survive 
finally most of us are going to live out our lives in our native countries do we want them to stay the same nations we grew up in some time in the future todays youth will be running the show while were elderly what kind of a place do we want it to be by then western civilization is great lets keep it going",english,prisonplanet.com,No Image URL,conspiracy,0.0,title,cuckservatism topic

Jason Easley,2016-10-29T21:05:46.158+03:00,comey letter backfires as email scandal revival energizes hillary clinton supporters,"by jason easley on tue nov st  at  pm republicans are so far removed from reality that sean hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show and nobody noticed the difference share on twitter print this post 
republicans are so far removed from reality that sean hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show and nobody noticed the difference 
cnn reported the progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners in this case the fake news originated on a dubious site called your news wire which publishes a mix of true slanted and madeup news then like a game of telephone by the time the story got to hannity even the fake facts were wrong 
some rightwing websites spread the story which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop the fake news eventually reached the gateway pundit and to sean hannitys radio show 
after spreading the fake news to millions of listeners hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way i was dealing with more important issues like hrc crimes and lies and how cnn has been colluding with the clinton campaign and cheating bernie sanders 
hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes and how the election is being stolen from donald trump 
how hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the rightwing media echo chamber works nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the republican party belief has replaced fact conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs so that is what they provide 
it doesnt matter if the confirmation is true what matters is that the audience wants it to be true 
sean hannity is pushing fake news and he doesnt care 
this is why there is such a disconnect between republicans and the rest of the country republican voters are living in a fantasy land that donald trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the republican nomination 
the conservative media bubble is alive and well and because of this things will get a lot worse for republicans before they begin to get better",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TrumpHawkins.png,bias,1.0,pollster sees early impact comey clinton fbi email letter swing states,hrafnkell haraldsson wed nov nd know sick tired negative dark divisive dangerous vision behavior people support donald trump share twitter print post speaking reverend samuel delevoe memorial park fort lauderdale tuesday night hillary clinton interrupted donald trump supporter shouted bill clinton rapist doubt working reward offered infowars clinton none rather ignoring man issued stern rebuke stabbing finger man said know sick tired negative dark divisive dangerous vision behavior people support donald trump man continued shout waving sign crowd countered cries hillary hillary said time us say going backwards going forward brighter future protester escorted security clinton told man everyone like may angry something anger plan dont used dont exploited see protesters antics note neither roughed attacked clinton supporters sadly many angry white christians allowing exploited donald trump represents forces deprived american dream man clinton says taken everything given nothing last night florida hillary clinton taking nothing giving everything photo screen capture,1.0

donald trumps deputy campaign manager the clintonobsessed republican operative david bossie told abc news george stephanopoulos this morning that theres an enthusiasm gap and that this bit of math republicans do is trumps path to victory on november  
this is how the conversation went per cbs news sopan deb  as always highlighting the important bits 
stephanopoulos was not about to let bossie get away with the claim about trumps tax returns and hammered him on the issue hes going to release his tax return when he is not under audit david bossie trump deputy campaign manager httpstcoyxvgrjix 
 good morning america gma november   
bossie deflected like a pro you can see why trump hired him 
as a corollary to bossies claims trump suddenly found himself interested in polls again this morning tweeting  wow now leading in abc  washingtonpost poll  to  gone up  points in two weeks mostly before the crooked hillary blowup 
 donald j trump realdonaldtrump november   
the trump campaign has always been about making much out of nothing elections are not rigged if trump gets his way and neither are polls if trump is leading otherwise its all leftwing shenanigans 
however even newt gingrich isnt buying the new poll washington postabc poll is an absurdity trump has not moved up  points in the last  dayshe was never  points behind ignore polls 
 newt gingrich newtgingrich november   
and what trump fails to mention is that his lead disappears if johnson and stein are taken out of the mix then clinton leads by   
these latest claims are an absolute sham as clinton leads overwhelmingly in early voting and comeys email gambit seems to have failed to sway voters to trumps camp 
meanwhile trumps own legal problems are beginning to overwhelm the narrative  and if there is any evidence of a clinton enthusiasm gap it exists only in bossies own head 
david bossie is living proof that clintons vast rightwing conspiracy is real and all the hating on hillary isnt going to change the fact that it is trump who is the crooked candidate not hillary clinton",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hillary_Clinton_23705602384.jpg,bias,1.0,comey letter backfires email scandal revival energizes hillary clinton supporters,jason easley tue nov st pm republicans far removed reality sean hannity spread fake news story radio show nobody noticed difference share twitter print post republicans far removed reality sean hannity spread fake news story radio show nobody noticed difference cnn reported progression events illustrates fake news stories expand spread fringe web sites nationally syndicated radio shows millions listeners case fake news originated dubious site called news wire publishes mix true slanted madeup news like game telephone time story got hannity even fake facts wrong rightwing websites spread story turned tall tale added new details stop fake news eventually reached gateway pundit sean hannitys radio show spreading fake news millions listeners hannity downplayed responsibility get facts right bottom line brought insignificant way dealing important issues like hrc crimes lies cnn colluding clinton campaign cheating bernie sanders hannity busy dealing real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes election stolen donald trump hannity put fake story air perfect example rightwing media echo chamber works nobody level bothered check facts republican party belief replaced fact conservative media knows audience wants confirmation beliefs provide doesnt matter confirmation true matters audience wants true sean hannity pushing fake news doesnt care disconnect republicans rest country republican voters living fantasy land donald trump able exploit ride whole way republican nomination conservative media bubble alive well things get lot worse republicans begin get better,1.0
Aaron Clarey,2016-11-13T19:09:28.982+02:00,buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression,"arent you surprised that hillary and the presstitutes havent blamed putin for fbi director comeys reopening of the hillary email case but the presstitutes have done the next best thing for hillary they have made comey the issue not hillary
according to us senator harry reid and the presstitutes we dont need to worry about hillarys crimes after all she is only a political woman feathering her nest just as political men have done for ages why all this misogynist talk about hillary the presstitutes cry is that comeys alleged crime is far more important this womanhating republican violated the hatch act by telling congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened a very strange interpretation of the hatch act during an election it is ok to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not ok to say that a candidate is under investigation
in july  comey violated the hatch act when he on orders from the corrupt obama attorney general announced hillary clean in so doing comey used the prestige of federal clearance of hillarys violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls
actually hillarys standing in the polls is based on the pollsters overweighting hillary supporters in the polls it is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions if you look at the crowds attending the two candidates public appearances it is clear that the american people prefer donald trump who is opposed to war with russia and china war with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election
hillarys problem has the ruling american oligarchy for which hillary is the total servant concerned what are they going to do about trump if he wins will his fate be the same as john f kennedy robert kennedy martin luther king george wallace time will tell or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the oligarchy got rid of dominique strausskahn
all of the american and western feminists progressives and leftwing remnant fell for the obvious frameup of strausskahn after strausskahn was blocked from the presidency of france and resigned as director of the imf the new york authorities had to drop all charges against strausskahn but washington succeeded in removing strausskahn as a challenge to its french vassal sarkozy
this is how the american oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests the corrupt selfserving oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities and of course through the presstitutes americans minds
the oligarchs are now hardpressed to rescue hillary as us president so lets see if the oligarchs can once again deceive the american people
while we wait lets concern ourselves with another important issue the clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the th century allowed a small handful of megacorporations to consolidate the us media in a few hands this vast increase in the power of the oligarchy was accomplished despite us antitrust law the media mergers destroyed the american tradition of a dispersed and independent media
but really what does federal law mean to the one percent nothing whatsoever the one percents power makes them immune to law hillarys crimes might cost her the election but she wont go to jail
not content with  control of the us media the oligarchy wants more concentration and more control looks like they will be getting it thanks to the corrupt us government the federal trade commission is supposed to enforce us antitrust law instead the federal agency routinely violates us antitrust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests
because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law we now have banks too big to fail unregulated internet monopoly and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media
not so long ago there was a field of economics known as antitrust phd candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power i assume that this field of economics like the america of my youth no longer exists
in the article below rahul manchanda explains that yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate to create another gargantuan media outlet in another consolidation of the enormous power money wealth intimidation conspiracy and control that eviscerates the us constitution and the first amendment
just what does federal trade commission antitrust division do anymore delivered by the daily sheeple

whether or not youre a basketball fan youre going to love this story about a bold new humanitarian initiative from the nba in order to help alleviate the refugee crisis in europe the league is housing syrian refugees on whichever half of the court isnt being played on during the game 
now thats making a difference way to go nba 
since the syrian civil war began in  millions of syrians have been displaced but thanks to the generosity of the nba some of them will now find a new home right around the threepoint line on the half of the court that isnt being played on at that time while players occupy one half of the court syrian refugees will have a safe and welcoming space on the other half to reassemble their lives until the ball changes possession and they are shuttled to the opposite end 
wow what a beautiful gesture from the nba with  courts across the country and  games in the  season the league is set to provide housing that periodically oscillates from one half of the court to the other for several thousand syrian refugees this is huge 
in contrast to europes notoriously overcrowded refugee camps the nbas half courts are big enough to comfortably house at least five families around the perimeter and one or two in the paint the refugees also have access to any snack vendors who happen to be milling about the crowd near whichever half of the court theyre on at the time 
of course its a new program and its not perfect there have been several incidents in which refugees have collided with players after failing to get to the other half of the court in time and last night an yearold syrian girl had to be treated for minor injuries after lebron james dunked on her during a fast break 
still according to nba commissioner adam silver the program is a huge step up from the refugee camps abroad 
the syrian refugee crisis is only getting worse meanwhile weve got this half of the court that isnt being played on just collecting dust waiting to be put to good use said silver adding that he felt the league had a moral responsibility to harbor the refugees if we can help these people by sheltering them on one side of the court until theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half as soon as theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half until theres a change in possession then we have an obligation to do that 
its refreshing to see a major organization like the nba reaching out to a group of people who so desperately need our help right now faith in humanity restored",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3429/8/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,0.0,said find miley cyrus alicia vikander zadie smith say,email whether youre basketball fan youre going love story bold new humanitarian initiative nba order help alleviate refugee crisis europe league housing syrian refugees whichever half court isnt played game thats making difference way go nba since syrian civil war began millions syrians displaced thanks generosity nba find new home right around threepoint line half court isnt played time players occupy one half court syrian refugees safe welcoming space half reassemble lives ball changes possession shuttled opposite end wow beautiful gesture nba courts across country games season league set provide housing periodically oscillates one half court several thousand syrian refugees huge contrast europes notoriously overcrowded refugee camps nbas half courts big enough comfortably house least five families around perimeter one two paint refugees also access snack vendors happen milling crowd near whichever half court theyre time course new program perfect several incidents refugees collided players failing get half court time last night yearold syrian girl treated minor injuries lebron james dunked fast break still according nba commissioner adam silver program huge step refugee camps abroad syrian refugee crisis getting worse meanwhile weve got half court isnt played collecting dust waiting put good use said silver adding felt league moral responsibility harbor refugees help people sheltering one side court theres change possession sheltering half soon theres change possession sheltering half theres change possession obligation refreshing see major organization like nba reaching group people desperately need help right faith humanity restored,1.0
Louis Stuart,2016-11-22T20:00:00.000+02:00,how we can win the propaganda war,"home  be the change  nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time jay syrmopoulos august    comments 
washington dc  one of the architects of the national security agencys surveillance programs dropped a bombshell over the weekend when he stated that the nsa has all of hillary clintons deleted emails he also noted that the fbi has the technical and legal ability to gain access to them if they chose to do so 
william binney is a former highly respected nsa official that served the agency for over  years helping to create its surveillance program  before becoming a famed whistleblower upon resigning in  on sunday he declared in a radio interview broadcast that the hack of the dnc could have been coordinated by someone inside the us intelligence community angry over clintons compromise of national security data with her email use 
appearing on sunday on aaron klein investigative radio and speaking as an intelligence analyst binney questioned whether the hack of the democratic national committees servers were actually the work of russian hackers as the clinton camp has alleged instead he raised the possibility that it was actually the work of disgruntled us intelligence officials upset about clinton being given a pass on criminal charges after compromising national security secrets through her use of unsecure personal email servers that were undoubtedly accessed by numerous foreign intelligence services 
during his interview with reporter aaron klein binney referenced thenfbi director robert s muellers testimony in march  before the senate judiciary committee in which mueller spoke of the fbis ability to access a number of secretive databases to track down known and suspected terrorists 
now what he mueller is talking about is going into the nsa database which is shown of course in the edward snowden material released which shows a direct access into the nsa database by the fbi and the cia which there is no oversight of by the way so that means that nsa and a number of agencies in the us government also have those emails binney said so if the fbi really wanted them they can go into that database and get them right now binney stated in regards to the missing clinton emails 
when klein asked whether he believed the nsa has copies of all of clintons emails including the deleted correspondence binney replied with a oneword bombshell yes  he responded that would be my point they have them all and the fbi can get them right there 
according to a report by breitbart  
and the other point is that hillary according to an article published by the observer in march of this year has a problem with nsa because she compromised gamma material now that is the most sensitive material at nsa and so there were a number of nsa officials complaining to the press or to the people who wrote the article that she did that she lifted the material that was in her emails directly out of gamma reporting that is a direct compromise of the most sensitive material at the nsa so shes got a real problem there so there are many people who have problems with what she has done in the past so i dont necessarily look at the russians as the only ones who got into those emails 
the observer defined the gamma classification 
gamma compartment which is an nsa handling caveat that is applied to extraordinarily sensitive information for instance decrypted conversations between top foreign leadership as this was 
how interesting to think about the distinct possibility that the hacked and leaked emails are not the result of russian hackers but actually came to wikileaks from an unknown crusader at the nsa itself  another snowden if you will 
let us hope that after for years of watching clinton expose national security secrets through reckless handling of highly classified intelligence some determined patriots within the intelligence community are now working to see the downfall of clintons by exposing their corrupt political apparatus likely we will never know as zero hedge reported  it is the nsa that has been tasked with determining if the russian government is behind the hacks one thing we already know is that when an agency investigates itself it never finds itself responsible share",english,returnofkings.com,No Image URL,hate,1.0,feminism giant shit test,hillary clinton waiting wings stage since dnc speech philadelphiasaying arrived hours members production crew sources confirmed thursday presidential nominee hillary clinton waiting wings wells fargo center stage since six oclock morning deliver speech democratic national convention depressed buttercovered tom vilsack enters sixth day corn bender losing vp spot washingtonsaying grown increasingly concerned husbands mental physical wellbeing since last friday christie vilsack wife agriculture secretary tom vilsack told reporters thursday despondent buttercovered cabinet member entered sixth day destructive corn bender passed democratic vice presidential spot dnc speech proud say walked bill hillary sex friend clinton family describes hillary america never gets see one saw sex trump sick tired mainstream media always trying put words sort context new yorkemphasizing practice evidence journalists bias republican presidential nominee donald trump stated thursday sick tired mainstream media always attempting place words kind context whos speaking dnc day guide major speakers addressing attendees final night democratic national convention bound gagged joaquin castro horrified identical twin brother might dnc floor philadelphiastruggling free tightly wound lengths rope binding wrists ankles together bruised gagged texas congressman joaquin castro reportedly horrified identical twin brother secretary housing urban development julian castro might floor dnc thursday obama hillary fight protect legacy even truly detestable parts philadelphiaemphasizing former secretary states competence tenacity democratic national convention address wednesday night president barack obama praised hillary clinton someone would work tirelessly defend advance legacy built even truly repugnant parts tim kaine clearly tuning middle boring vice presidential acceptance speech philadelphiadescribing look total disinterest face noting kept peering watch speech progressed sources democratic national convention said virginia senator tim kaine clearly began tuning partway boring vice presidential acceptance address wednesday night cannon overshoots tim kaine across wells fargo center philadelphianoting vice presidential nominee launched nearly feet air entrance democratic national convention wednesday night sources reported cannon back wells fargo center accidentally overshot tim kaine across arena sending crashing stage several dozen feet beyond erected safety net biden regales dnc story girl band vixen breaking hard rocks glass ceiling philadelphiadevoting large portion speech pioneering stiffyinducing allfemale quartet vice president joe biden regaled democratic national convention wednesday night rousing story metal band vixen breaking hard rocks glass ceiling late,0.0

Mike Rivero,2016-11-23T00:49:00.000+02:00,flashback  hillary clintons kkk smear against trump was democrat strategy,"november   by wire leave a comment 
the person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the white house it may well be donald j trump but further due diligence is required to ensure that american democracy is not threatened 
st century wire says 
although the election was called on nov th the democratic partys ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming president is still ongoing 
for those of us with long enough memories the democratic party their media operatives and the clinton campaign were claiming that trump and the gop would be engaged in this very same behavior after hillary clinton won the presidency as expected 
notice how the shoe is now on the other foot 
its interesting reading past stories by news sources linked to the clinton campaign and john podesta as politico has who ran a feature on aug th entitled why the gop will never accept president hillary clinton which lays out the case of hillarys lock on the white house and how the evil republicans will not accept her eventual election victory 
will donald trump respect the peaceful transition of power howled cnns wolf blitzer in the runup to the election the question now is will the democrats respect the result and simply move on as they say 
of course we now know that journalists like wolf at cnn were getting their talking points directly the clinton campaign  
as it turns out the only thing illegitimate about the  election was the mainstream corporate media 
more form the guardian 
the guardian 
a growing number of academics and activists are calling for us authorities to fully audit or recount the  presidential election vote in key battleground states in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers 
the loose coalition which is urging hillary clintons campaign to join its fight is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week according to two people involved 
the document which is currently  pages long focuses on concerns about the results in the states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin 
im interested in verifying the vote said dr barbara simons an adviser to the us election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting we need to have postelection ballot audits simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement 
a second group of analysts led by the national voting rights institute founder john bonifaz and professor alex halderman the director of the university of michigans center for computer security and society is also taking part in the push for a review and has been in contact with simons 
in a blogpost early on wednesday halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching 
unfortunately nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now in the next several days to petition for recounts he said 
the developments follow clintons surprise defeat to donald trump in the  november vote and come after us intelligence authorities released public assessments that russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from democratic officials before the election

sen marco rubio rfla took the stage in orlando at calle orange a puerto ricanthemed festival on sunday when some in the crowd started booing npr reported  
the jeering got louder as the cubanamerican senator seeking reelection after dropping his presidential bid earlier this year was introduced 
and when the emcee asked for applause as rubio took the same boos drowned out any supporters in the crowd npr added 
thank you for having me today rubio said in spanish i want you to enjoy this day were not going to talk about politics today thank god for this beautiful day and for our freedom our democracy our vote and our country god bless you all thank you very much 
he left the stage to more boos from the crowd according to the report 
snip 
rubio is running against rep patrick murphy d and the latest average of polls in the race shows rubio ahead by about  points 
murphys campaign seized on the sunday incident and blasted out video it says shows the booing it also noted that murphy attended the festival with a leader for puerto rican communities rep nydia velazquez while marco rubio was booed off the stage 
rubios campaign shared a video with the hill monday that it says counters what the murphy campaign sent out and shows him being greeted enthusiastically as he moves through the crowd 
snip 
festival attendants said they disapproved of rubios endorsement of trump who is deeply unpopular among hispanics 
when we have someone like trump who hits our mexican brothers our latino brothers then you jump on that bandwagon after all that stuff he says not only about you personally    as a latino youre a freaking sellout i would not vote for him if they paid me calle orange attendant angel marin told npr about rubio

Mike Rivero,2016-11-21T03:44:07.262+02:00,the death of john kennedy,"print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov  
first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you 
second im not endorsing donald trump in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate 
third i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore 
fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st donald i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see john  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation 
fifth my decision to vote for trump barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if trump won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once trump became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary for two strong warnings about hillary see here and here  
so what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump 
the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected 
second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote 
third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole 
fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home 
fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for trump 
sixth trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president 
seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority 
so in sum  my hope is in god not donald trump and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil 
in the end if trump gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice 
either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive michael browns

No Author,2016-10-27T17:30:23.655+03:00,glp forum godlike productions,"disclaimer this is not legal advice if you are charged with a criminal offense or think that you may be contact your attorney 
if you are a western man under  your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography epic divorce rates hypersexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity at virtually any age you could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier it wasnt something remarkable and youve both probably forgotten about it years later you could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case
while american culture evolved or as many fairly and convincingly argue de volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws
federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent instead leaving it to the states to codify though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under  and you may think thats the law of the land federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution by the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her right good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography 
what is the age of consent in america i wouldnt even trust her fake id
the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from  to   sometimes lower in the case of married couples its even lower in some foreign countries by the way say youre an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country but still under you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty
why is this significant for starters the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of  to be a child that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic however
dont take one for the team
for example back when you were  and your girlfriend was  and the age of consent in your state was  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since
till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier thinking nothing of it you tell him the basic details admitting to sexual contact and bam you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor any defense of her consenting multiple times or even that you did not know she was underage is irrelevantas a minor she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges
the long arm of the law may reach you 
well thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway right not so fast first if you have amassed any assets years later she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask bill clinton 
moreover just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you do not assume you are in the clear statutes of limitations can be changed  once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game
while the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl perhaps even if you yourself were underage if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction
this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute continue to keep quiet regardless prosecutors come and go and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges
branded for life 
if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry  perhaps for life say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you well guess what you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction
imagine driving down the road years later a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice a sex offense arrest pops up think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny what are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day for better or worse cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible
you will get no breaks so watch yourself and stfu yes of course you both knew what you were doing back on prom night and yes we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences  but you sir are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white nonislamic and attending college or boarding school particularly a prestigious institution  forewarned is forearmed
young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation and if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader dont tell that story to anyone ever the political climate is not favorable to youand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-03T18:46:55.411+02:00,fbi wiretapped corruption suspect discussing clinton deals,"whos really to blame for the corrupting influence of money in washington dc november   walter williams 
microsoft cofounder bill gates having a net worth of  billion and amazoncom ceo jeff bezos having a net worth of  billion are the nations two richest men they are at the top of the forbes  list of americas superrich individuals people who have net worths of billions of dollars many see the rich as a danger new york times columnist bob herbert wrote it doesnt really matter what ordinary people want the wealthy call the tune and the politicians dance his colleague paul krugman wrote on paper were a onepersononevote nation in reality were more than a bit of an oligarchy in which a handful of wealthy people dominate its sentiments like these that have led me to wish there were a humane way to get rid of the rich for without having the rich around to be whipping boys and distract our attention we might be able to concentrate on whats best for the  percent of the rest of us 
lets look at the power of the rich with all the money that gates bezos and other superrich people have what can they force you or me to do can they condemn our houses to create space so that another individual can build an auto dealership or a casino parking lot can they force us to pay money into the governmentrun  and doomed  obamacare program can they force us to bus our children to schools out of our neighborhood in the name of diversity can they force us to buy our sugar from a highcost domestic producer rather than from a lowcost caribbean producer the answer to all of these questions is a big fat no 
you say williams i dont understand let me be more explicit bill gates cannot order you to enroll your child in another school in order to promote racial diversity he has no power to condemn your house to make way for a casino parking lot unless our elected public officials grant them the power to rip us off rich people have little power to force us to do anything a lowly municipal clerk earning  a year has far more lifeanddeath power over us it is that type of person to whom we must turn for permission to build a house ply a trade open a restaurant and do myriad other activities its government people not rich people who have the power to coerce us and rip us off they have the power to make our lives miserable if we disobey this coercive power goes a long way toward explaining legalized political corruption 
take just one of thousands of examples the fanjuls are among the biggest sugar cane growers and they coown the worlds largest refining company american sugar refining which markets its product under the brand names domino ch redpath tate  lyle and florida crystals during the  election cycle florida crystals contributed more than  to candidates and political spending groups it spent more than  million lobbying congress the us departments of agriculture and commerce and the office of the us trade representative heres my question to you do you think it forked over all that money to help our elected representatives uphold and defend the us constitution nonsense the fanjuls and other sugar producers want congress to use tariffs to keep foreignproduced sugar out of our country so they can reap the financial benefits from being able to charge americans two to three times the world price of sugar 
so heres the ultimate question if some rich people can line the pockets of politicians to do their bidding at the expense of the rest of us whos to blame i think its we the people who are to blame for not using our votes to run such politicians out of town  and thats most of them but that might be deceitful of us for we also ask politicians to enable us to live at the expense of others",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hill1.png?itok=2WFcOaHn,hate,1.0,hillarys castro endorsement,nigerian novelist wonders everyone loves hillary november daniel greenfield everyone love hillary clinton hard say unfavorable ratings hit makes popular bubonic plague obamacare osama bin ladens corpse much go atlantic decided run piece chimamanda adichie titledwhy hillary clinton widely loved response seeing name chimamanda adichie probably huh unless youre gender studies student ivy case know exactly love chimamanda adichie nigerian novelist whose feminists big circles clinton campaign unbearably awkward panegyric adichie obvious attempt channel canned obama poetry like hillary branding fails badly howlers like millions admire tapestry hillary clintons past people hillary clinton becomes first woman president united states weep joy quite hymn comrade stalin getting means except tow truck theres phrasing oh phrasing hillary clinton guilty immediately stepped view american public first lady arkansas awkward attempt channel obama poetry instead reads like dvd manual badly translated japanese atlantic piece full lines straddle border tineared propagandistic cliche bad writing lawyer full dreams guilty traditional first lady offended old patriarchal order theres theme article deny reality conservative writer labeled congenital liar first lady label stuck repeated overand convenient label harness misogyny liar hostility engendered could possibly first lady refused still silent liar reemerged election even though politifact respected source information politicians certified honest politicians perfect timing defense would right hillary clinton shouted rally new york dont worry hillary honest politicians site supporting said words repeated context begun breathe thrum life especially emails press coverage emails become unclear morass emails must mean something terrible often invoked classified emails illegal server violation regulations dealing handling classified material thats got lots context coverup people love hillary clinton know system state department old stodgy nothing like blackberrys smooth whirl hillary clinton used blackberry wanted keep using became secretary state people love hillary know love high tech blackberry hillary love blackberry lawyer full dreams fights children migrant workers loves smooth whirl politifact thrums life says blackberry honest iphone hillary many dreams thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly offend traditional stodgy patriarchal order system american conservative media saw opportunity blow emails story proportion soon followed almost bashfully rest american media works nigeria thats works america objective basis equate hillary clinton opponent theyre mammals need oxygen live theyre better writers chimamanda adichie people love hillary clinton see failings general american media news entertains rather informs bristle benign stories covered ominous tone bristle hug blackberry weep fear patriarchal stodgy systems prevent hillary thrumming first lady north america know bit careful understand cannot afford spontaneity would think six figure speeches could afford little actions falsely magnified leaned caution wrapped kind caution sometimes makes appear stilted wrapped caution whirling blackberry one hand bristled public retracting quills occasionally hissing informed fashion children migrant workers admired tapestry past millions americans selfindulgent expectation politician perfect frustrated hillary clinton allowed complexity get beyonce phone think adichie got another hit,1.0

Jack Kerwick,2016-10-28T07:55:05.430+03:00,social justice vs truth,"propalestinian propaganda lowering standards of truth in america manipulation by doctored narratives in every sphere october   
reprinted from israelnationalnewscom  
commendably organized american jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott delegitimize and sanction israel however focusing primarily on israel and not also on america and europe is shortsighted 
the bds campaign has not devastated israel economically israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed israels good name and has rendered her and jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic academic and mob attacks 
it has also lowered the standards for truth among americans this is a very important point 
an islamicstyle of jew hatred has merged with western politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for palestinians fakestinians which has infiltrated every corner every crevice of our lives and world it has infected americans and europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class race and ethnicity 
this is utterly astounding amazing really something like this does not happen overnight 
the bds campaign is rooted in the arab league plo and soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mids in the mids the un proposed its infamous zionismracism resolution 
in  the day after israel won yet another war of selfdefense israelnot the arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier 
by the late s edward saids treacherous lying work had begun to have its way with western academics and with westernstyle academics in israel european governments and international organizations 
i only realized how successful his campaign was in  when israel was demonized at a un conference on women in copenhagen the soviets the iranians the arab league the plo roamed the hallways chanting death to israel european feminists called upon palestinian refugees but refused to hear jewishisraeli refugees from arab and muslim countries by  the un world conference against racism in durban was an even more outofcontrol hate fest and riot against israel 
as we approach  un resolutions against israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque unescos recent decision to dejudaize jerusalem the western wall and the first and second temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend at the same time proisrael professors and students in america are increasingly being harassed even fired 
such lies have infiltrated my private social world for example at a recent holiday dinner our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink 
a likeminded gathering yes not exactly one man a genial wellheeled welleducated jewishamerican suddenly began hectoring us about the palestinians what if they did not hate the jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize jews and israelis what if they were peaceful wouldnt we have to admit that palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own you cant deny that the palestinian people have always lived there can you oh my where to start the company included two authorscholars who between them have published  books and thousands of articles many of them dealing with the history and nature of islam tribal gender and religious apartheid israel and antisemitism etc among us was a third author who had also served four tours of duty in the idf i held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table this man was punching way above his pay grade and i could not understand why 
the two authorscholars presented facts cited statistics i pulled down book after book from my shelves we got nowhere look he said i have some really good muslim friends theyre americans totally westernized they are palestinians they strongly feel that this is their identity why deny them the identity of their choice and then i understood that the propalestinianantizionist propaganda behind the relentless bds campaign is successful precisely because so many americans of all ages are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly dont care 
fair is fair he said in other words whats good for the jews has to be good for everyone else if not the jews dont deserve whatever it is either 
heres a man whos not an antisemite or an antizionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonjewish palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than  the year that another stateless peoplethe jewschose a national sovereign identity 
he would not listen to reason it was quite astounding how is this possible 
his mindset is part of our ruling american zeitgeist if rachel dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the naacp if a man can say that hes really a woman trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen yes anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do 
i am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to false ideas that psychologically speaking we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult 
facts alone will not work we must consider all known techniques for deprogramming 
this is one of our greatest challenges",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/nm_1.jpg?itok=2YWPFbXh,hate,1.0,zineb el rhazoui charlie hebdo survivor discusses world needs destroy islamic fascism,hillary clinton seeks even unfit secretary state october daniel greenfield never read medieval german folk tales hillary clinton counting chickens theyve hatched preparing hand jobs one handed hand shes busy planning fantasy cabinet fantasy administration big pick makes sense reportedly would like make joe biden secretary state biden obvious choice hes arrogant dumb brimming bright ideas like giving iran money splitting iraq little pieces obviously wouldnt competency pick last time someone qualified secretary state president bushs time office democrats decided would give job consolation prize failed presidential candidates foreign policy important could counted make even bigger mess hillary clinton john kerry joe biden perfect plan want fall guy blame everything dont come obvious joe biden want someone shadowed soft bigotry low expectations youve gotta go joe joe biden could accidentally start ww everyone would shrug say thats joe,1.0
Alex Ansary,2016-11-02T18:22:23.260+02:00,russiaus plutonium deal no longer in effect,"fbi releases clinton foundation investigation records  
daily caller 
the fbi on tuesday released documents related to a nowclosed federal investigation of an alleged paytoplay scheme involving bill clinton and the clinton foundation 
the documents which are heavily redacted regard the investigation of clintons lastminute pardon of marc rich a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in the us for tax evasion 
the jan   pardon sparked the last controversy to befall the scandalplagued clinton administration richs exwife denise donated more than  million to various clinton and democratic entities including the democratic national committee hillary clintons new york senate campaign and the clinton foundation 
the release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized but the dump is noteworthy for two reasons it reminds voters that the clinton white house and clinton foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning paytoplay allegations the clinton foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple fbi field offices 
it also comes as the fbi is locked in a bitter standoff with the clinton foundation and the justice department over fbi director james comeys handling of the hillary clinton email investigation 
the newlyreleased files include one entry which shows that the required pardon standards and procedures were not followed prior to the rich pardon 
roger adams the us pardon attorney at the time testified to congress in feb  that none of the regular procedures were followed ahead of the rich reprieve 
former attorney general eric holder is also mentioned in the file it cites holders testimony that he was the only person who worked at doj  he was deputy attorney general at the time  about the rich pardon from the fbis clinton foundation investigation files 
a grand jury was convened to weigh the merits of the case but no indictments were handed down ironically the law enforcement official who closed the case was fbi director comey he served as deputy attorney general in the george w bush administration 
the fbis website suggests that more clinton foundation investigation records could be coming in the future 
this initial release consists of material from the fbis files related to the william j clinton foundation  a nonprofit c organization the site reads the bulk of these records come from a  fbi investigation into the pardon of marc rich  aka marcell david reich by president clinton in  it was closed in  
the fbi did not respond to a request for more information on future releases 
update clinton campaign press secretary brian fallon questioned the release 
the fbi issued a statement late tuesday afternoon saying that the file was released in response to a foia request 
the fbis records management division receives thousands of foia requests annually which are processed on a first in first out fifo basis the statement reads 
by law foia materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the fbis public reading room shortly after they are processed per the standard procedure for foia these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the fbis public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures",english,amtvmedia.com,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/581787bec46188db298b45b4.jpg,bs,0.0,russiaus plutonium deal longer effect,fbi releases clinton foundation investigation records daily caller fbi tuesday released documents related nowclosed federal investigation alleged paytoplay scheme involving bill clinton clinton foundation documents heavily redacted regard investigation clintons lastminute pardon marc rich billionaire fugitive wanted us tax evasion jan pardon sparked last controversy befall scandalplagued clinton administration richs exwife denise donated million various clinton democratic entities including democratic national committee hillary clintons new york senate campaign clinton foundation release provides little way information already publicized dump noteworthy two reasons reminds voters clinton white house clinton foundation embroiled investigation concerning paytoplay allegations clinton foundation reportedly investigated present multiple fbi field offices also comes fbi locked bitter standoff clinton foundation justice department fbi director james comeys handling hillary clinton email investigation newlyreleased files include one entry shows required pardon standards procedures followed prior rich pardon roger adams us pardon attorney time testified congress feb none regular procedures followed ahead rich reprieve former attorney general eric holder also mentioned file cites holders testimony person worked doj deputy attorney general time rich pardon fbis clinton foundation investigation files grand jury convened weigh merits case indictments handed ironically law enforcement official closed case fbi director comey served deputy attorney general george w bush administration fbis website suggests clinton foundation investigation records could coming future initial release consists material fbis files related william j clinton foundation nonprofit c organization site reads bulk records come fbi investigation pardon marc rich aka marcell david reich president clinton closed fbi respond request information future releases update clinton campaign press secretary brian fallon questioned release fbi issued statement late tuesday afternoon saying file released response foia request fbis records management division receives thousands foia requests annually processed first first fifo basis statement reads law foia materials requested three times posted electronically fbis public reading room shortly processed per standard procedure foia materials became available release posted automatically electronically fbis public reading room accordance law established procedures,1.0
admin,2016-10-27T16:41:44.825+03:00,meet peter kadzik  another clinton stooge at the justice department,"last week i expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions  these matter much in prompting us to take action or not to to think about something or not to sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls ignore our own needs or refraining from caring about our own interests whereas others push theirs every day they can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after shortterm pleasure or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and fingerwaving against men of their own kin
pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking rather it is the exact opposite as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotiondetermined actions once we have gained awareness of passions we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why
following this idea i made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy hope and love today i will do the same with four other passions or emotions admiration shame humility and fear
 admiration 
society i think should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta malesas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundarieshence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor of course this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy unmanly men women should also be trained into validating more manlier men and here admiration comes into play
as nassim taleb put it we are living more and more in an extremistan where those at the highest level take the lions share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder girls today tend to admire only the most famous or highstatus people which leads them to despise the ninetynine per cent this exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man as long as he achieves the minimum andor is upstanding and dutiful gets his fair share a more democratic but still conditional distribution of girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition 
girls should also admireand not mockproper feminine role models upstanding mothers females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl
 shame 
shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short if our actions fall short and we fail to notice we can be shamed or made to notice shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed but unlike embarrassment also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others neel burton heaven and hell  chap p
a particularly strong emotion shame usually comes as a blow makes one lose face or composure to eventually feel guilt or remorse just like other strong emotions it has been used with consumed malignancy by the left
leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery the holocaust an oppression of minority groups or racism as these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt the sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up being shamed as a racist or nazi can be enough to endure rejection from ones family lose reputation and employment
shame can be aroused through two levers the standards one agrees with and ones purported responsibility both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberalfavored groups as for the standards feminists attacked what they called slutshaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior and as for the responsibility pretty much all those who claim to identify with a minority tend to deny all by slipping it over the majoritys shoulders
this is how you get persistent offenders or jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse whereas the productive working and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white in the current year better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading europe than a young virgin of european descent
what we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice as people evidently hate being shamed especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others
shame the fatties  shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious recall the selfdetermination of antiwhite liberals and criminals they all made free choices they should carry all associated responsibility
as for us we must keep our face straight never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical sjws if they appeal to moral standards put forth your own as legitimate if they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility emphasize theirsand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors
even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn likewise granting certain people or groups a constant deresponsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything criminals of said groups have agency and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well
shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable the liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens in spite of how much the latter to house the former allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terroristswhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ist or phobic acquaintance
turn the table shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long
 humility 
current year girls overinflated ego is enough notwithstanding economic or racial factors to explain a host of social problems blinded by it girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings shortterm desires or by the latest fashions around they drink loads of booze fuck with random strangers reframe their story as a rape later so they can blame it all on the guy  they never learn to cook clean take care of something else than their instagram account and corporate career speaking of corporate isnt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment sex and have almost nothing whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can havetakeit all
ego makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance it leads to complacency merciless exploitation of others refusal to take responsibility and open despise
augustine of hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues this makes sense if ones ego is inflated one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomingsthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury parce que je le vaux bien  as says a famous brand of cosmetics instead of focusing on selfimprovement or caretaking
though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed as the survival of basic family units depends on it bloated ego is a general disease in our age men too can be sold the idea that say being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves its not all about our individual selves
 fear 
readers asked for it so here it is fear is a very powerful emotion to the point of prompting one to freeze flee abandon a previously planned course of action or never even think to consider an idea or an action the left has been using it in two different albeit complementary ways
first it has constantly accused conservatives to play on fears implying irrational or unjustified fears when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment when the  immigration act was voted democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of america and that any suspicion it might happen was highly emotional in france the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations here the left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable fear
well what happened since doesnt it look like every fear from the right was justifiedespecially since the postww right has always been incredibly wary not to say coward when it came to criticize the lefts moral high ground
second the left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do namely stirring fear about political bogeymen liberals invented rape culture or patriarchal oppression when men actually became weaker they associated to nazism any white person who assumes his race should basically survive they shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call white supremacists as if defending ones right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being hitler himself
whites were led to fear their own supposed authoritarian tendencies as the shrewd jews who intrigued through the frankfurt school put it see kevin macdonald culture of critique  chap whites were led to fear some of their fearsbetter have ones daughter killed by muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites because racism is so evil boo
when i was younger i noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people they were much more fearless they had this devilmaycare provocative attitude which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females not incidentally the first movie of the french essayist alain soral confessions dun dragueur confessions of a womanizer shows a young arab with decent pickup experience taking a young middleclass white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity
feeling fear is a necessary step in life fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being fearful or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fearmongering
on the flip side being feared by others is not always a negative some people need to be afraid to respect you if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity they will harm and exploit you such people just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect should be kept in check by a minimal fear better be feared and respected than getting tread upon
conclusion frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to as you have to the left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing when we fail whatever the reason we are despised as weak or losers and when we succeed they say we are privileged and oppressive in both cases the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us no matter what we actually do 
fortunately it is always possible to turn the tables provided we keep a tight frame and change these emotions as well for example when we are weak we should elicit empathy be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities and when we are strong we should elicit admiration and trust
think frame feel positive about us and about what we do get rid of those who wont

David Risselada,2016-10-31T13:12:47.326+02:00,the deceptive nature of hillary clinton is right in line with communism,"posted on october   by claire bernish 
censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted 
facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown 
and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case 
recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang 
that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image 
ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest 
but taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  
trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters 
in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake 
according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives 
in addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals 
all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others 
company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand 
for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors 
indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification 
although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error 
in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences 
earlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots 
however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative 
in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part 
and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids 
after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives 
senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  
in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards 
while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and

Paul Reinhardt,2016-10-26T22:46:37.467+03:00,no title,"click for full size picturek my theory 
my theory of the downing of the aircraft is derived from the two reported wreckage sites the lie about the weather given out by the government and the loss of three radio links at the same time while the plane was still  miles from the crash site signs the plane was sabotaged 
first off the claims made in both time and newsweek that ron browns plane crashed in the worst storm in a decade are directly contradicted by the weather report issued by the dubrovnik airport tower adjacent to the crash site the storm simply did not exist 
while the plane carrying ron brown and his party was still  miles from the crash site  mile in the air and on the normal approach path three radio based links with three separate propagation paths all failed at the same time 
according to the aviation week  space technology article the dubrovnik tower lost voice radio contact at the same time the aircraft vanished from the screens of the approach radar at split and an awacs 
lets look at the split radar first 
the split radar watches the approach to dubrovnik airport which is where the ron brown aircraft was when it dropped off of the radar screen contrary to some silly claims made in this newsgroup before the plane was not flying in the mountains it was out over the water with open space all around the radar at split routinely tracks aircraft through that airspace without problem if it were normal for the split radar to lose traffic at that point on the approach path nobody would have mentioned it because it would be normal and expected behavior nothing unusual about it that comment was made about the target dropping off of the split radar establishes that it was an unusual event 
the split radar like all atc radar tracks primarily by aircraft transponder so when the split radar lost track of the ron brown aircraft what was lost was the transponder return as the aircraft was still on the approach path although just starting to veer slightly left 
now lets look at the awacs 
the awacs system is designed to track nontranspondered targets radar hits are placed in a computer system that keeps a list and tries to match the returns from the present radar sweep to the returns from the previous sweeps in order to generate meaningful target tracking data for the operators and weapons management systems part of that process involves target to target comparisons to make certain that what the computer thinks is target xyz this sweep is the same target it thought was xyz last sweep the total workload on the computer is a power function of the total number of nontranspondered targets being carried in the target list 
if a target has a transponder the awacs will track the target using the transponder return because not only is less computer power needed for a transpondered target but the workload for nontranspondered targets is reduced 
how do we know that the awacs was tracking the ron brown plane via transponder because the awacs lost its track at the same time that the split radar lost its transponder return had the awacs been tracking the ron brown plane via skinpaint there is no reason for it to lose track of the aircraft at the same time that split did 
had the awacs not reported losing contact we could surmise that either the awacs was tracking on skin paint or the split radar suffered a momentary failure but this was not the case 
it is also true that the awacs could have immediately reacquired the ron brown aircraft on skin paint and its not known for a fact that the computers did not add it as a nontranspondered target but the awacs was there to watch bosnia not the dubrovnik airport 
the two radar tracks propagating along two different paths come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and that is the radar transponder in the ron brown aircraft a failure of the transponder is the only explanation for the ron brown plane vanishing from two different radar screens at the same time while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea 
at the same time that the aircraft vanished from the radars at split and the awacs the dubrovnik tower reported it lost voice radio contact with the aircraft 
this is a third distinct propagation path from the awacs and split in fact its direct line of sight from the dubrovnik tower to the location on the approach path where radio contact was lost there are no intervening geological features to block the radio signal the dubrovnik tower continued to communicate with other aircraft in the area so the radios in the tower were not at fault 
the data reported in the aviation week  space technology article shows evidence that two sperate systems on board the ron brown aircraft failed at the same time the cockpit radios and the radar transponder 
the radios and radar transponders come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and lose voice radio contact with the dubrovnik tower and that is is the electrical system failed in mid air while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea on the approach path how do we know the problem extended beyond the electrical system 
simple prior to the loss of radio the flight crew had acknowledged receiving a weather report they knew there was clear air beneath them there is only one reason for the flight crew suddenly without any instruments at all not to descend out of a cloud layer into the clear air they knew was below them and thats if the event that severed the electrical cables also severed the flight control cables which occupy the same midline conduit in the  possible trigger 
given the unscheduled nature of the trip a timer would be useless to pinpoint the exact geographic location of the detonation however knowing the approach pattern into the airport a location over the adriatic can be selected by the altitude of the aircraft along the glide slope 
the simplest explanation which fits the twin wreckage sites and the early news reports of a water crash is that of an altitude triggered bomb placed on the aircraft prior to departure as the aircraft climbs above a certain altitude the device is armed as the aircraft descends through the trigger altitude say  feet the device detonates why did the plane make it to shore 
as the reports have pointed out the weather was not ideal the pilot even with the best navigation aids in the world would be fully justified in delaying his descent in order to stay in clear air as long as possible then ducking quickly down through the clouds to find the airfield 
this means that the altitude triggered bomb would have detonated far closer to land than expected with the result that portions of the wreckage came on shore 
the  mile spread between wreckage sites indicates an airborne event which blew part of the aircraft off the same  mile distance coupled with the shallow impact angle suggests that the aircraft was still flyable and that the pilot may have been trying to make it to the airfield when the crash into the hill occurred was thermite used 
its impossible to state based on the information available to the public but thermite is a definite possibility it can be made using available materials and will not show up on the various detectors which would sense chemical explosives such as c thermite when ignited burns at half the temperature of the surface of the sun and would burn through the aluminum of an aircraft with ease packed in a suitcase near the top of the baggage compartment of the converted  it would be in an ideal location to sever the control linkages and to short out the planes electrical system as well as burning a hole through the skin dumping debris into the ocean how bad was the weather 
there were several reports in the media that dubrovnik was in the grip of the worst storm of the decade this is not true as can be seen by the weather information contained in the aviation week article and the first news articles from reuters the weather was not exceptionally bad indeed the wind conditions were excellent providing a  knot head wind with no cross component at the runway perfect landing conditions below the overcast at  feet visibility was km or  miles assorted news articles washington april  upi  a us air force plane carrying commerce secretary ron brown in the

wednesday on the fate of his friend and political ally commerce secretary ron brown made emotional visits to browns home and the federal department where he spoke to distraught federal workers after hearing mid morning that the military plane carrying brown had crashed near the adriatic coast in croatia clinton wasted little time in sharing his grief and trying to console the brown family friends and workers the browns have a son michael and a daughter tracey a family spokesman said the browns were still holding out hope the president and first lady hillary rodham clinton dressed in dark suits and wearing solemn faces spent nearly an hour at browns washington home where he lived with his wife alma couriers also arrived with flowers from wellwishers and the secret service checked each bunch before allowing them into the townhouse the clintons emerged from the home located in the affluent secluded chatworth neighborhood of washington with their heads down and the first lady appearing to choke back tears brown was head of the democratic national committee when clinton was the partys presidential nominee in  and he was greatly credited with playing a key role in putting a democrat in the white house after the visit with the family the clintons immediately headed across town to commerce department headquarters where the president addressed employees who packed the auditorium clinton told the gathering that he his wife and other administration officials came to be with the employees of the commerce department at this very difficult hour the plane carrying secretary brown and his delegation including a number of your colleagues business leaders and leaders of the united states military went down today near dubrovnik croatia clinton told the workers we do not know for sure what happened there clinton said he asked browns wife what he should tell the department workers she said tell them ron was proud of them that he liked them that he believed in them and that he fought for the commerce department and tell them that youre going to do that now clinton said winning sustained applause from the crowd many of the hundreds of department employees were visibly shaken at the news with many crying and others holding and consoling one another also present at the commerce department when clinton spoke were several cabinet secretaries including attorney general janet reno agriculture secretary dan glickman housing and urban development secretary henry cisneros health and human services secretary donna shalala education secretary richard riley and interior secretary bruce babbitt vice president al gore and the first lady also joined clinton at the commerce department earlier sen ted kennedy dmass visited the brown family to express his condolences brown was kennedys chief of staff before going to the urban league and democratic national committee clinton named him commerce secretary in  another visitor was vernon jordan former head of the urban league and now a highpowered washington lawyer and unofficial adviser to clinton  a us air force t which is the military equivalent of a bowing  carrying brown and his entourage from tuzla to dubrovnik crashed into a mountain near the adriatic sea coast but officials were writing off the possibility of foul play there hasnt been any report over here indicating anything hostile but again we cant confirm that white house spokesman mike mccurry said republicans in congress have been working to dismantle the commerce department although a gop aide said wednesday the effort may be scrapped following the crash of browns plane washington reuter  president clintons wife hillary and daughter chelsea flew on the same plane last week that crashed in croatia with commerce secretary ron brown aboard us air force sources said wednesday a military version of the widely used boeing  passenger jet flew mrs clinton and her yearold daughter from the turkish capital of ankara to the ancient biblical city of ephesus and on to istanbul last wednesday the ta plane with a tail number of  was based at the us air base at ramstein germany the sources said mrs clinton used it rather than the boeing  assigned to her for a weeklong goodwill tour of southern europe because of the short runway at ephesus the same plane was used to ferry defense secretary william perry in and out of bosnia last week mrs clinton also visited the yugoslav region during her trip but used a giant c military cargo jet for that leg of her journey

Troy Francis,2016-11-02T18:01:28.236+02:00,habits all successful seducers share,"one of the foundations of living a good life in todays times is having a good place to call home whether you want a solid comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies recover from the days tribulations and just to be or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits or both a good home is essential to the modern man
i purchased a home and i decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations my home was an asoriginallyfurnished home of the s and i brought its multicolor painted green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed hardwoodfloored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style a general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site source the labor follow the schedule get the materials and execute the vision of the plan here are ten things i learned as my own general contractor
 there are good contractors and there are bad contractors 
you will run into both good and bad contractors out there a good contractor does good work at good value follows the schedule and is honest and doesnt lie to you a bad contractor will do any or all of the above i fired a contractor who had good value but did poor work could not follow the schedule and lied to me i paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work hit the schedule on time and was a perfectionist give a bad contractor a second chance mainly to see how he corrects it and if he fails to shape up cut him loose
a good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork but no more some firms i turned down did things by hand and had no contractors license and that is too little whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanics lien on your home if you do not pay is too much
a lot has to do with the presentation of the representative tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands but a man that does not have a good handshake good eye contact and is evasive on important details is shady
 good contractors cost more and they are busy the best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule and i mean they are booked often a month or so in advance the guy i fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night which while it seems like hes busy hes actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs
a good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them and he will when awarded the job put you in his schedule at an agreedupon time my best contractor was so busy that i had to do other things first before i could get his firm to bid my work and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy they turned down my work until later
 you need to establish a reputation 
general contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they subcontract to and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation
a busy contractor will work with a gc who will give them work in the future over one who will not i was an unknown so the busy guys during the busy season fall and preholidays would pass on me and work with ones they knew
however word got around to the others that i gave jobs of good scope and paid on time i hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs and once they found out who i used as my electrician it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to they called and the electricians vouched that i was picky as all hell but paid on time and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house at that point i was in
 good contractors know other good contractors 
reputation works the other way too a good roofer who i only turned down because he was too busy and wouldnt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above although you should always get multiple competing quotes bid to three two will generally respond and pick the better one the deciding factor was that his brother the roofer ran a good shop and it stood to reason he would too
my plumbers knew my ac guys and my chimney guy my flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys everyone works with and around everyone else and i saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that on any future projects i know who to call for what and even if i dont know i know who to ask for recommendations
 it will take more money than you think it will 
home renovation is expensive and its mainly for the nasty reason that once you commit to action you can get hit with extra costs you can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what but you will find that the home will need things you didnt think about or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted or materials will simply cost more
part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now and what to spend money on later right now i live in the place finally but i still have construction paper down on my floors as i have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas my bathrooms have plumbing in but no mirrors cabinets towel racks or toilet paper holders entire rooms are without furniture all of these can and should be taken care of later but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier
 it will take more time than you think it will you may not need something this complicated but a gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others
contractors have their own schedules and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit you have to juggle quotes they have to then write you in then they do the work then theres followups and punchlists and then finally that job is done and you pay them
you cant do some other jobs before you finish the first one this is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters my floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors but they did not when they were laying subfloor and i was able to have plumbers in that day as well contrariwise i could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done
 some of your ideas are wrong some are right i had my own thoughts about what to do with the place sometimes i was wrong it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood even though it was the same color and i listened to my contractor and used new sometimes i was right my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the countertops colors and the ratio of white i wanted was correct but i was persuaded to add more by my contractor
know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how instead of the what i have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures they did what i wanted but did it in a better way than i would have suggested and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process
 there will be gaps in your manpower coverage 
the one thing a professional general contractor does that you as a private operator will not is do all the basic stuff themselves a gc will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself my electricians did install and hang them for me anyway
this was for two reasons and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job the first is to provide all the materials yourself which also allows you to pick out what you want i had a pile of fixtures fans and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done
the second reason is to provide a good scope of work will a plumber come install a single faucet maybe will he come install five and a garbage disposal certainly thats a good days work so if you have little jobs have a lot of little jobs and youll get more interest
 there are things with which you will not be satisfied good enough is good enough 
this house is old but renovated some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval i cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is  years old and it had popcorn texture on it some things i did not address i have new baseboard and new window trim but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time
some things were done but were not perfect the drywall where my kitchen cabinets bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where even after two reworks still has a hairline paint crack some of the window film has pull away lines and theres a couple things trapped under the film in places one of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue you cannot have perfection but you can go for reasonable excellence
 code enforcement sucks the man sucks someone called code enforcement on me and i had to go get a permit of a cost of x of the renovations cost mainly so they can jack my taxes up
i got the permit and i expect my taxes to go up the inspector was a real schmuck as most appointed officials are but the jokes on him as i only got the permit on what i had left to do and i omitted some things that would still happen but werent too noticeable
with code enforcement and county ordinances the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken instead of flouting the law i went and got the permit when i was busted for it but they only know a third of the story had i gotten a permit earlier perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all another tactic which i will do on a future project i have planned is to get the permit months ahead of time then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices
conclusion if you have the time the patience and the skill to know exactly what you want who to get for it and how to juggle a massive schedule running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational if you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead

as infowars has highlighted  there have already been numerous reports of early voters in texas seeing their ballots flipped from donald trump to hillary clinton a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
while election officials have dismissed the reports suggesting user error is to blame tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time 
larry norden a voting technology expert told npr that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed 
over time as people vote that calibration becomes less and less accurate norden noted 
during elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping indeed the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as the simpsons drew attention to it 
meanwhile the washington post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering trumps rigged election claims 
callum borchers author at the washington post blog the fix writes since the final presidential debate last week many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to donald trump supporters your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election nov  a day later the timess upshot blog increased clintons chances of winning to  percent  an alltime high on monday politicos ben schreckinger wrote that  donald trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed  here at the fix chris cillizza and aaron blake wrote that  donald trumps chances of winning are approaching zero  these are accurate statistically sound statements but they are something else too declarations that trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us  
the latest polls which trump insists are rigged due to oversampling show clinton with a double digit lead 
however hillary clintons campaign manager robby mook has warned that trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right 
weve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before election day mook said urging clinton supporters to vote 
make no mistake with only  percent of votes cast donald trump could win this election mook said   ",english,prisonplanet.com,http://static.infowars.com/images/INFOWARS_stacked.jpg,conspiracy,0.0,leaked emails reveal hillary cant speak long without podium debates rigged,daily mail october republicans say theyll keep heat hillary clinton wins oval office new investigations family charity quid pro quo allegations judicial watch conservative group thats forefront clintons email scandal already talking impeachment notyet president know generation republican leaders loath exercise tools impeachment something thats relevant organizations president tom fitton told nbc news fitton noted however congressional republicans unlikely follow advice see oversight process opportunity measure keep opponents offkilter dont want substantive principled work truly hold corrupt politicians administration anyone accountable charged republicans capitol hill gearing bevy new investigations involving clinton next congress,1.0
Vicki Batts,2016-10-28T09:33:59.765+03:00,claim watching scary movies could help boost your immune system and promote weight loss,"jimmy johns owner spent k to trophy hunt extremely endangered female black rhino 
tuesday november   by ethan a huff staff writer tags jimmy johns  endangered species  trophy hunting naturalnews the owner of the american fast food chain jimmy johns is under fire after photos emerged of him smiling and giving a thumbs up beside numerous endangered species that hes hunted and killed throughout africa over the years for seemingly no other purpose than simply to invoke death for pleasurereports indicate that jimmy john liautaud has been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars per hunting trip to gain access to these precious species including one particular trophy hunt in which he spent a whopping  just to kill an extremely endangered female black rhino graphic photos of liautaud with this rhino and other animals are available here  but be warned these images are horrifyingly upsettingliautauds trophy hunts are apparently a routine pastime of his just as they are for the many other bored millionaires out there with too much time and money on their hands who seem to get a kick out of taking out the rarest animals on our planet  beautiful creatures like leopards rhinos lions and even elephants which have the largest brains of any land animals its the type of thing that if more people knew about it theyd likely stop eating at jimmy johns altogethermr jimmy johns poaching fetish has been making the media rounds and many are now calling on a national boycott of the sandwich chain which has already been exposed for underpaying its employees and treating them like slave workers the wall street journal wsj reported that social media users had attempted to launch a boycott of jimmy johns using the boycottjimmyjohns hashtag on twitter though the company didnt seem all that phasedstill the issue hasnt gone away and many in the public remain outraged over what they say is reckless and reprehensible behavior not only is liautaud killing these rare and exotic animals in cold blood but hes doing so in such an utterly cruel way that even the most avid hunters would be hardpressed not to cringe or perhaps shed a few tearsusually the animals are lured from a national park on to private property lara starr investigative writer and cofounder of the earth child writes noting that this is not the method liautaud uses to kill his prey trophy hunters will leave out bait play the sounds of other animals to lure them in or a few other tactics to find their animal victimscanned hunting is even worse she adds it is the shooting fish in a barrel version of trophy hunting  the animals are often hand raised so they are tame and dont run away they leave food out for them one day then some coward creeps up and shoots them with a high powered bow or rifle sometimes they dont even have to creep sometimes they just shoot them from the back of a truck then go back to drinking their gin  tonic like it was just a bit of harmless fun trophy hunting costs do not help repopulate endangered animal species one of the excuses often used as justification for expensive trophy hunting escapades is that all that cash ends up getting donated to conservation programs that help repopulate the prairies plains and jungles with endangered species but this isnt actually true as only about two percent of the proceeds from these hunts ends up being used for conservation purposesnontrophy hunting tourism on the other hand is responsible for the bulk of conservation donations  up to  times than what trophy hunting contributes  according to heather callaghan editor of natural blaze  likewise the claim that animals killed on trophy hunts are used to provide food for locals is also bunk as most of the carcasses end up getting left behind for scavengers

Jason Easley,2016-10-29T03:41:08.886+03:00,the real reason why the clinton email scandal is back has nothing to do with helping trump,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  am a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror share on twitter print this post 
a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror 
the report alleges that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin and that russian intelligence claims to have compromised trump on his visits and could blackmail him 
david corn at mother jones reported 
mother jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote the first memo based on the former intelligence officers conversations with russian sources noted russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting trump for at least  years aim endorsed by putin has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance it maintained that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin including on his democratic and other political rivals it claimed that russian intelligence had compromised trump during his visits to moscow and could blackmail him it also reported that russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on hillary clinton based on bugged conversations she had on various visits to russia and intercepted phone calls 
the former intelligence officer says the response from the fbi was shock and horror the fbi after receiving the first memo did not immediately request additional material according to the former intelligence officer and his american associates yet in august they say the fbi asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources the former spy forwarded to the bureau several memossome of which referred to members of trumps inner circle after that point he continued to share information with the fbi its quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on he says 
in august corn reports the fbi asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he continued to share information with the fbi which he says made it clear there was a pretty substantial inquiry going on 
if this report is accurate the spys information confirms what senator harry reid says intelligence experts and fbi director james comey already shared with him regarding explosive information regarding ties and coordination between donald trump and russia 
this report also rings true given report about the trump server repeatedly being connected to russia including trumps server possibly communicating with a russian bank 
it also makes sense given the many ties to russia within trumps own campaign and indeed trumps own rhetoric regarding nato and russia trump changed the republican party platforms proukraine proposals and talked about weakening nato both of which mirrored putins wish list nbc reported monday evening that the fbi is in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps excampaign managers connection to russia 
donald trump has already been busted for reading russian propaganda at his rallies as newsweeks kurt eichenwald uncovered an instance of trump reading propaganda directly from putin at a rally in pennsylvania 
eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the russians have been hacking into american emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election the russians have been obtaining american emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of themfalsifying themin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election the big question of course is why are the russians working so hard to damage clinton and in the process aid donald trump 
the answer to why putin is trying so hard to defeat clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her unlike donald trump hillary clinton is no pushover according to former us officials putin sees clinton as a forceful proponent of regime change policies that the russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival 
trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the kremlin hes been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy he is easily flattered and easily manipulated its also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him  see the billy bush bus tape of trump bragging about sexual assault trump is easy bait 
the fact that the fbi director felt compelled to announce something about hillarys emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aides emails and even then he wasnt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates but he chose to keep this explosive information about donald trumps ties to russia under wraps is very disturbing 
this isnt a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the fbi follows about ongoing investigations this is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate but the fact that they come from different sources and that trump willingly staffed his own campaign with russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak  these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-07-07T163623Z_1_LYNXNPEC6616G_RTROPTP_4_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON-COMEY.jpg,bias,1.0,trump supporter jailed trying rig election committing voter fraud,letter james comey hillary clinton email scandal motivated democrats clinton campaign says raised million online last hours lisa lerer ap reported clinton campaign says theyve raised online last hrs since clinton became nominee convention lisa lerer llerer november comey letter supposed boost trump depress democratic turnout opposite appears happening james comeys interference presidential election motivated clinton supporters work harder give money get polls republicans wanted democrats seen comeys letter republican spin october surprise failed instead made hillary clinton even stronger giving campaign resources use close presidential election political tactic comey letter harming republicans republicans thrown everything think hillary clinton nothing stopped hillary clinton supporters continue grow stronger donald trump marching back reality television star clist celebrity obscurity,1.0

with millions of eyes watching cnn for election results tonight the network really couldnt afford any highprofile screwups but unfortunately thats exactly what they got when john king tapped his touchscreen electoral map too hard and plunged himself straight into a digital hellscape from which there seems to be no escape 
ouch thats some major egg on cnns face 
the night appeared to be going smoothly in the networks washington studio until king tried to zoom in on a breakdown map of crucial ohio swing districts when the map seemed to freeze up a frustrated king tapped the magic wall with enough force that his whole arm plunged through the suddenly fluid surface of the screen before wolf blitzer or anderson cooper could step in he had been fully engulfed in a vast virtual expanse of colorful swirling data 
with millions of americans tuning in to watch the results of this historic election cnn has been forced to press on even as they try to free john king from the computerized map a noticeably emotional wolf blitzer mouthed the words im sorry to his imprisoned colleague before tapping the board to call up a gender breakdown of likely oregon voters the bar graph of which animated right into john kings spine launching nearly all the way to the midatlantic states if cnn producers thought that they had stabilized the situation by urging king to take refuge in the bottom corner of the screen it did not take long for them to realize how wrong they were when connecticut was called for hillary clinton the trapped john king was also turned entirely blue and let loose a horrible scream as if he were being burned alive this level of panic was matched moments later when king tried to fend off a ravenous piece of malware with just his loafer only for the shoe to shatter into pixels that the code devoured 
yikes cnn will be wondering for a while how this all went so wrong and on their biggest night too 
with plenty of states left to declare tonight theres still time for king to be rescued from the computerized nightmare but with uploading a jpeg of a ladder for him to climb up and trying to shepherd him onto a thumb drive having already failed to return king to the studio cnn may be running out of options

Gillian,2016-11-06T21:00:44.777+02:00,angel messages for november   video,"by wmw_admin on october   sanchez manning  daily mail oct   
the bbc has been accused of acting recklessly after targeting children as young as six with a programme about a schoolboy who takes sexchange drugs 
parents are angry that the show available on the cbbc website features a transgender storyline inappropriate for their children 
and concerned campaigners said it could sow the seeds of confusion in young minds the programme just a girl depicts an yearolds struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty making it easier to have sexchange surgery in the future 
one mother writing on the mumsnet website said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video she said her girl who likes wearing boys clothes and playing football had asked me anxiously if that means she was a boy 
tory mp peter bone said it beggars belief that the bbc is making this programme freely available to children as young as six i entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children 
it is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the cbbc website and i shall be writing to bbc bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible 
former culture secretary maria miller voiced her concerns over the bbc tackling the subject in an ageappropriate way saying such issues should be raised where children can have support from parents 
and tory mp julian brazier said this programme is very disappointing and inappropriate children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them 
family campaigner norman wells said it is irresponsible of the bbc to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex 
just a girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself amy and dresses as a girl it is hosted on the cbbc website aimed at children aged between six and  
in the halfhour programme amy  played by an actress  reveals she was born a boy called ben but has already started using pubertyhalting drugs 
such hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when the mail on sunday revealed an nhs clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine 
critics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery with many realising they are gay the bbc row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues fuelled by a number of highprofile cases in one a christian couple were threatened with having their yearold daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy 
in another a sevenyearold boy was ordered to be removed from his mothers care as she was raising him as female causing him a great deal of emotional harm 
in just a girl amy says when i was born mum said dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football but mum knew i was different she realised early on that i was born in the wrong body 
she adds my mum supported me when i did a powerpoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that i wasnt going to come to school in boys clothes any more but girls clothes i wasnt ben i was amy 
later amy is shown telling a friend josh  a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl  that she is on hormone blockers saying it took ages to get them after loads of tests and talks at the clinic once they realised i was trans for real i got them she says in another entry amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called liam but confides liam thinks im just a girl but im not im trans and whats he going to say if he finds out stop being my friend why im still me arent i 
child psychotherapist dr dilys daws said the programme could confuse children she said that while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex the bbc was irresponsible to feature the extreme step of gender change for sixyearolds because they were too young to grapple with such issues 
the programme generated hundreds of comments on mumsnet 
one mother who said her sevenyearold had watched the show asked am i being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group 
another replied dont think this is remotely suitable for a sevenyearold to start suggesting that children can be transgender when theyre far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging a small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible that sometime in the future hell wake up with a girls body 
another user added i dont think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than yearolds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised 
other critics slammed the bbc mr wells director of the family education trust said the more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girls body and a girl can be born into a boys body and that drugs and surgery can put things right the more children will become utterly confused respecting and preserving a childs birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue

us who want donald trump as their president in less than  hours americans will go to the polls to elect a new president but no matter what happens on election day nov  trump will not win the majority of the black vote many of them are expected to heed the message of president obama who has warned that the republican candidate will undo his administrations legacy but trump s messageto make america great againmight still draw an unlikely group of supporters from within the black community african immigrants foreignborn africans make up a small share of the us immigrant population but their numbers have been doubling every decade since  african immigrants living in the us grew from  in  to  million as of  according to a study from the pew research center this group of voters say they are supporting trump because of a blend of ideals that his candidacy represents as the new flag bearer for conservative traditional politics a political outsider who has chipped away at political correctness a successful businessman who has consistently reinvented himself to achieve the american dream and a man sure to deliver them from what they see as the disappointing presidency of barack obama  despite trump s antiimmigrant rhetoric some african immigrants have been dissatisfied with obama s middling africa policy and think real change from an outsider like themselves could make a positive difference for america their own fortunes leading this pack is none other than president obama s kenyan halfbrother malik the yearold naturalized us citizen has spoken about his own brothers leadership as deep disappointment and said that trump was providing something new and something fresh to the american people some of the african trump supporters like malik have also voiced their concerns about the moral relativism that has pervaded us politics from abortion rights to marriage equality to the current debate on transgender bathroom use i tried to coexist with my brother barack

beverly hills calif  more than  of hillary clintons biggest donors crowded into the home of casey and laura wasserman here on thursday night each having written a check for at least  to snag a ticket the hollywood glitterati in attendance  elton john performed on the piano barbra streisand mingled in the crowd  were sending her off for the home stretch of the campaign with north of  million in fresh funding 
it was a fitting capstone to a remarkable  months for clinton on the lucrative california fundraising circuit this final event anchored by a host committee of billionaires hollywood executives media moguls and tech investors  sean parker jeffrey katzenberg haim saban chris sacca  that each directed  to clintons efforts 
clinton calls them her hillblazers campaign bundlers who have given or raised at least  for her campaign and she has erected an unparalleled and unprecedented infrastructure of  such people  nearly double the number of any past presidential candidate including president obama four years ago 
while clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors it is these bundlers in more than  states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation combined this elite andup club has amassed a minimum of  million for clinton and the democratic party  and the actual figure is likely far far higher than that the biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns 
we had the best base of donors and bundlers and raisers ever in  it was even better in  and its much better in  than  said wade randlett a san franciscobased democrat who has raised money for clinton obama and democratic causes for decades the obama people basically  percent in are favor of hillary theres really no loss because of ideology or bad blood and she has added an enormous number of people especially women 
among her bundlers are celebrities will smith and sports stars earvin magic johnson hollywood directors steven spielberg and george lucas and corporate executives marissa mayer and sheryl sandberg wall streettypes marc lasry media executives haim saban and anna wintour and members of congress including her running mate sen tim kaine who helped raise more than  for clinton before he joined the ticket in july 
the clinton campaign said  percent of its bundlers are women 
there are also federal lobbyists from whom the democratic party under obama refused to accept money a prohibition that has since been rolled back 
this club has expanded to the point where clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom as of the end of june she counted  such individuals and couples by the end of july it was  on august  it was  
it includes billionaires george soros warren buffett and tom steyer super lobbyists like steve elmendorf and boldfaced names like calvin klein and jj abrams there is also a sprinkling of longtime clinton family advisers such as vernon jordan",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14774994921475744757e-800x454.png,conspiracy,0.0,isis declares kill palestinians one one yet remains quiet israel,email beverly hills calif hillary clintons biggest donors crowded home casey laura wasserman thursday night written check least snag ticket hollywood glitterati attendance elton john performed piano barbra streisand mingled crowd sending home stretch campaign north million fresh funding fitting capstone remarkable months clinton lucrative california fundraising circuit final event anchored host committee billionaires hollywood executives media moguls tech investors sean parker jeffrey katzenberg haim saban chris sacca directed clintons efforts clinton calls hillblazers campaign bundlers given raised least campaign erected unparalleled unprecedented infrastructure people nearly double number past presidential candidate including president obama four years ago clinton advisers like tout small online donors bundlers states four foreign countries form true backbone financial operation combined elite andup club amassed minimum million clinton democratic party actual figure likely far far higher biggest bundlers typically collect millions campaigns best base donors bundlers raisers ever even better much better said wade randlett san franciscobased democrat raised money clinton obama democratic causes decades obama people basically percent favor hillary theres really loss ideology bad blood added enormous number people especially women among bundlers celebrities smith sports stars earvin magic johnson hollywood directors steven spielberg george lucas corporate executives marissa mayer sheryl sandberg wall streettypes marc lasry media executives haim saban anna wintour members congress including running mate sen tim kaine helped raise clinton joined ticket july clinton campaign said percent bundlers women also federal lobbyists democratic party obama refused accept money prohibition since rolled back club expanded point clinton would struggle fit bundlers single ballroom end june counted individuals couples end july august includes billionaires george soros warren buffett tom steyer super lobbyists like steve elmendorf boldfaced names like calvin klein jj abrams also sprinkling longtime clinton family advisers vernon jordan,1.0

Kit Daniels,2016-10-27T18:25:45.168+03:00,podesta who told hillary she could use private email,"three quarters of americans oppose gun control record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban steve watson  infowarscom  october   comments 
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order 
clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime but would bankruptand eventually endgun manufacturing in the united states newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vote.jpg,conspiracy,0.0,exclusive christs burial place exposed first time centuries,chinese university sells hiv testing kits vending machine china yearoveryear increase disease image credits david pursehouseflickr china experienced growth rate hiv past several years one university taken steps allow students test placing hiv testing kit vending machine next regular fare like snacks china seen yearoveryear increase infection rates likely prompted southwest petroleum university nanchong city sichuan province install test kits sichuan province one top three provinces china disproportionately high rate hivaids together two provinces high rates disease three account half cases hivaids entire country new hiv cases occur due homosexual activity kits retail taken urine test determine whether students need seek medical attention purchase test collect urine send laboratory access results online done completely anonymously similar kits purchased online retail around cheaper vending machine tests accurate partially subsidized charity allow test accessible reports state chinese limited sex education little discussed hiv aids many students suspect may disease seek medical help link homosexuality hiv often thought pariahs families friends connection samesex encounters disease mostly spreading amongst young homosexual men anywhere else women use proper protection also susceptible becoming infected doctors stated young people become infected hivaids china lacked proper education take appropriate precautions prevention joint united nations programme hivaids unaids states currently half million people china living hiv aids however figure may inaccurate due underreporting,1.0

Game Is A Modern Rite Of Passage That Helps Turn Boys Into Men,2016-11-03T02:26:51.256+02:00,comment on  things indian guys have to understand when learning game by game is a modern rite of passage that helps turn boys into men,"how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe 
daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   books 
written in  the camp of the saints is a novel by jean raspail that predicted the european migrant crisis forty years before it began not only the actual invasion by brown migrants but also the leftist arguments that enabled it which ushered europe to its doom 
the story follows a onemillion strong flotilla of indians who are slowly making their way to europe the leaders and people of europe have decided not to stop their arrival light on action the book focuses on the mood of the pending arrival particularly how europeans were eager to cuck themselves into oblivion 
after all your helpall the seeds and drugs and technologymigrants found it so much simpler just to say heres my son heres my daughter take them take me take us all to your country and the idea caught on you thought it was fine you encouraged it organized it but now its too big now its out of your hands its a flood a deluge and its out of control  
youve gone and worked up a race problem out of whole cloth right in the heart of the white world just to destroy it thats what youre after you want to destroy our world our whole way of life 
raspail understood how the media whips the public into feeling immense guilt as a mechanism to introduce nonwhite migrants well before the globalist view on migration and equality was elucidated raspail was steps ahead in predicting what the result of it would be as if he was reading into a crystal ball he even knew that migrants would bring diseases like tuberculosis  
and all at once whole sections of new york are deserted a score of american cities watch the flight to the suburbsand half the historic paris pavement tooamerican tots in their integrated schools fall five years behind tubercular gauls flee in droves from our openair clinics  tallyho tallyho just listen to that battering ram smash at the southern gate 
the centurieslong segregation of the first and thirdworld brought great complacency upon europe no one could really get a grasp of what was in store once the thirdworld reached critical mass and started invading the west 
i can tell vilsberg continued that you really dont believe how serious the situation is after all we lived side by side with the third world convinced that our hermetic coexistence our global segregation would last forever what a deadly illusion now we see that the third world is a great unbridled mass obeying only those impulsive urges that well up when millions of hapless wills come together in the grip of despair 
in a bittersweet scene one of the prominent media leftists goes out with his wife to celebrate the arrival of the flotilla with joyous africans towards the end of the party his wife gets brutally raped by them and he eventually dies in sorrow the hordes arrival suddenly awakened all the immigrants already in the country into asserting themselves they began stealing directly from the native citizens by attacking their white privilege 
now its a known fact that racism comes in two forms that practiced by whitesheinous and inexcusable whatever its motivesand that practiced by blacksquite justified whatever its excesses since its merely the expression of a righteous revenge and its up to the whites to be patient and understanding 
what drives the maniacal leftist raspail believes its a suicide mechanism likely activated by a human organism void of spirit and with no reason to endure a cosmopolitan existence attempting to destroy its host culture is an indirect way of killing itself 
whenever the pop tunes would lose their blaring charm there was nothing left but to let oneself drown in the stickysweet syrup of human misery and despair set to music of sorts that one refuge of yearning and unfulfilled souls that had learned nothing else it never occurred to any of them to measure that notion of misery against the past or against their own wellbeing for them it was a drug and they needed to shoot up a good strong dose to keep themselves going like addicts and their heroin the fact that it was often hard to come by close to home made very little difference nothing stops an addict when he has to have his fix and poisons like that are easy to import theres never a lack of pushers besides modern man has always had tucked away in the back of his mind that singular longing for total destruction sole cure for the boredom and anguish that consume him 
the book even predicted a cucked catholic church raspail knew that every institution had to be on board with europes destruction for the thirdworld invasion to proceed seamlessly 
i came south like a lot of other priests father to hail what i thought would be mankinds redemption to welcome the million christs on board those ships who would rise up reborn and signal the dawn of a just new day 
the european women who welcomed the refugees became whores for them if you think this is too extreme consider that european women are getting raped by migrants today but not reporting the crime  yet if a white man so much as brushes past them hes accused of assault  
she died in nice in a whorehouse for hindus disgusted with everything in general and herself in particular at the time each refugee quarter had its stock of white women all free for the taking and perfectly legal  
yes the third world had started to overflow its banks and the west was its sewer 
raspail even predicted the fact that the media would elevant the interracial couplings of white women and the invaders we saw something similar recently when the german government sponsored sex workshops for migrants on how to fornicate with german girls 
ralph ginzburg the famous american publisher had printed a series of photos in his magazine eros which had caused not a little ink to be spilled they showed an interracial couplewhite woman black manin various stages of nude embrace with a caption that read as follows tomorrow these couples will be recognized as the pioneers of an enlightened age in which prejudice will be dead and the only race will be the human race 
the fleet made landfall in france the french impotent to do the right thing to save their country tripped head first into spreading the welcome mat they actually competed with each other to see who would be the most welcoming you can imagine the result when one million wretches made landfall in a country they cared nothing about the new social justice government that rose forth catered to the invaders more than the french similar to what we already see in western european nations 
in war the real enemy is always behind the lines never in front of you never among you always at your back thats something every soldier knows in every army since the world began and plenty of times theyve been tempted to turn their backs on the enemythe socalled enemy that isand give it to the real one once and for all  
when freedom expands to mean freedom of instinct and social destruction then freedom is dead 
the book itself wasnt my style of storytelling raspail made numerous detours and longwinded soliloquies that took away from the action in favor of creating accurate character portrayals its more of a mood novel than one that moved forward at an exciting pace the only flaw is that it didnt predict the rise of an alternative media that would sound the alarm bell even though an active invasion is taking place today the antimigrant side is far stronger than whats portrayed in the book 
the camp of the saints was a prophetic story that showed how the migrants themselves werent the only cause of europes destructionleftists played the largest role in ripping apart the country before their arrival a fact that many of us already know too well nov   roosh valizadeh",english,returnofkings.com,No Image URL,hate,1.0,reasons create fat control laws obesityfree zones,like sigh every time skimread synopsis new lgbt agendaapproved blockbuster septic tank hollywood releases usually stars anorexic aids ridden cowboy teams lovestarved transexual fabulous journey open borders districts america carpet muncher falls love female tortured artist heroin addict next door female remake ghostbusters sponsored cheetos whiskas clintonapproved work art recipient ingsoc academy award put muzzle balls selfinflicted humiliation mythical heroes triumphing odds mad max waits patiently car bonehead empowered go grrrrl takes decisions seems turn towards russia recommended daily dose normal masculinity red pill coldblooded gets brother brat russian movie directed alexey balabanov seen many one greatest gangster movie time changed forever image traditional justiceseeking hero years least want share discovery film readers tremendous impact way see world attitude towards life convinced quality impact could disciples red pill lines cannot justice giant russian cinema culture entirely deserves article brother criminal enter danila bagrov played stellar sergey bodrov died peak meteorlike career many called russian james dean serving bloody war theatre chechnya young veteran danila returns home sleepy provincial town tula needing money without solid prospects joins brother vytia works hitman local welldressed businessman saint petersburg expert making rudimentary weapons quick capacity reaction frugality danila adapts marvelously new occupation seeing risk gifted concurrent stealing livelihood citys gangsters soon put price head send professionals tie loose end even betrayed mix greed cowardice young danila bagrov decides take mob single handedly epitome russian alpha hard unforgiving sober words behaviour nothing counts bonds blood brotherhood err human one soft spot faith human nature convinced good fellow man virtuous return could wrong especially women discovers fast beta moves like buying gifts helping brings trouble ungratefulness rare makes danila stand loyalty cornerstone definition masculinity value progressively vanishes nowadays brother unthinkable storm clears danila emerges victorious proves quality man magnanimous giving second chance fancy green screen politically correct themes brat good painfully real embellish lawless chaos early postsoviet russia felt wall came everyone trying survive best way could odd lowquality orange filter used film reminds us period everything made people could find shelves empty cannot go wrong good revenge movie danila example bravery alone odds takes mafia wronged make pay man says like analysis city perverse influence men brutally accurate danila told city strength everyone weak hoffman city great terrible force sucks life force strong turns weak takes away power fell right middle opinion abuse power corrupt elites would kill mother father profit final victory truth applies especially well todays political social context american whats power really money brother says money youve got lots money truth real power whoever right strong cheated man took away money make stronger cause right person cheated means hes stronger right brother also drops lethal truths women ways spending roubles buying drinks dope young interchangeable skank tells danila kate condoms danila kate really think give back money come two brothers two majestic films second volume simply titled brother breaks stereotype sequels always awful least good better original characters followed time danilas brother arms played crooked american businessman touch muscovite mafia attacked brothers time cross atlantic reclaim rightfully movie realistic gritty lighter outlook life whereas first volume main character showed sheer hatred everything came america corrupted country sequel involves danilas adventures clueless discovery american culture often results hilarious encounters un film qui prend aux tripes red pill religion danila bagrov could patron saint watch legally following link includes english subtitles firm kinokompania stv produced film decided release online film household name russia worldwide needless say watch original russian second opus also found online english subtitles russian audio dont miss monuments russian cinema read youve already seen one greatest red pill movies ever made,0.0

in an interview with bill oreilly on thursday donald trump was again asked about the access hollywood tape in which the republican nominee was caught bragging about sexually assaulting women this time though he put up a new defense strategy at least when it comes to this particular issue  blame the microphone 
when asked by oreilly if he thinks he would be winning the election if not for the release of the video trump once again repeated that it was only locker room talk and then started complaining that a microphone shouldnt have been allowed to capture his comments 
shockingly he did not express any regrets for his language 
video 
 sean colarossi seancolarossi october   
it was locker room talk the microphone was not supposed to be on  it was an illegal act that was nbc it was not supposed to be on that was a private dressing room 
its amazing how often a microphone can be the root of a presidential candidates troubles 
it should also be noted that trumps complaint about his dressing room privacy being breached is particularly rich given his history of storming into the dressing rooms of teenage pageant contestants some as young as  years old 
when asked by oreilly if he would take legal action against nbcs role in uncovering and releasing the tape trump said youll see 
all of this comes after trump recently promised to sue the growing number of women who have come forward saying that they were sexually assaulted by him 
trump also spent an absurd amount of time in the interview complaining that the media is rigged not true voter fraud is widespread false and the polls are dirty theyre not

video 
clinton said 
hillary clinton could probably spend  hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting trumps hypocrisies 
while trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new dc hotel hillary clinton was winning more early votes in the state of florida there are two competing messages in the media currently about the election the first message is that democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting the second message is that a few state polls have shown trump leading by a little in florida and gaining ground in new hampshire 
it is possible that both of these stories are correct democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news some republicans may be coming back to trump 
the important thing for hillary clinton and democrats is not to let up democrats are very close to generation defining win but victory is not sealed yet more polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend but the polls may not matter 
if most of the ballots in states like north carolina and florida are cast before election day the polls may end up meaning very little 
hillary clinton is in a great position but judging from her own remarks she is still working hard to close the deal on november
