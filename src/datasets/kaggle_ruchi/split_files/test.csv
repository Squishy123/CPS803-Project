marlene,2016-10-27T13:22:00.569+03:00,comment on brother of clintons campaign chair is an active foreign agent on the saudi arabian payroll by marlene,"posted on october   by pamela geller 
the bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily its not a question of trump it is an imperative that hillary be defeated if the people choose hillary then they must and will be punished wikileaks bill clinton boasts of hillarys working relationship with muslim brotherhood by john hayward breitbart  october   
in a speech bill clinton gave at the home of mehul and hema sanghani in october  revealed to the public for the first time by wikileaks former president bill clinton touted hillary clintons working relationship with the muslim brotherhoods mohamed morsi in egypt as an example of her diplomatic skillspresident clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the iran nuclear deal in a passage that began with the standard democrat stuff happens shrugging defense for foreign policy failures 
finally we live in a world as i said thats full of good news and bad news the united states cannot control it all but we need a president whos most likely to make as many good things happen as possible and most likely to prevent big bad things from happening you cant keep every bad thing from happening whos most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way even the people who dont like the iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadnt been for the sanctions hillary negotiated those sanctions and got china and russia to sign off  something i thought shed never be able to do i confess im never surprised by anything she does but that surprised me i didnt think she could do it the chinese and the russians to see past their shortterm selfinterest to their longterm interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race 
and when the muslim brotherhood took over in egypt in spite of the fact that we were inaudible she developed a working relationship with the thenpresident and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a fullscale shooting war between israel and hamas in gaza which on top of what was going on in syria and the inaudible jordan would have been a calamity for the world 
and when we were trying to reset our relations with russia under president medvedev she and her team negotiated a new start treaty which limits warheads and missiles and she lobbied it through the senate she had to get  votes which means a lot of these republicans who say that they dont like her now are just kidding for election season they trusted her and she got it passed you cant get  votes in the senate without a lot of republican support and i dont know about you but with all this tension and mr putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in syria i think its a very good thing that were in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the russians she did that 
youll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the iran debacle than bill clinton boasting that the sanctions barack obama lifted were superawesome as even those who dont think those sanctions should have been lifted agree 
mr clintons version of the iran sanctions leaves out a few details  such as russias keen financial interest in keeping iranian energy out of the european market and chinas desire to use iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip 
but the part about the muslim brotherhood is most interesting if anything he is selling hillary clintons working relationship with egyptian islamists short because she used american diplomatic leverage for morsis benefit even before he got elected warning egyptians about backtracking to a military regime at a key moment of the postmubarak campaign when morsi was running against a former member of hosni mubaraks military there have long been rumors that more subtle forms of us  pressure  were used to secure morsis office as well 
then again in public pronouncements clinton called hosni mubaraks tottering regime stable and cautioned her obama administration colleagues against pushing a longtime partner out the door 
a few days ago declassified state department documents revealed clintons talking points for a  meeting with morsi hailed his election as a milestone in egypts transition to democracy and stated that she was to offer the muslim brotherhood leader technical expertise and assistance from both the us government and private sector to support his economic and social programs 
clinton was also supposed to privately offer morsi assistance with his police and security forces which would be conducted quite discreetly 
after morsi was gone she declared herself exasperated with egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical realist that is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the obama administration was saying while the arab spring was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but americaaligned or at least americafearing regimes which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long 
as for clintons superb working relationship with morsi that eventually ended with morsis wife railing against clinton for supposedly dismissing him as a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency and threatening to publish letters from clinton to morsi that would damage the former us secretary of state meanwhile mohammed morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the egyptian penitentiary system  
egypt has one of those icky military governments again and while it wont have fond memories of hillary clintons support for the muslim brotherhood regime it will most likely work with whoever wins the  us presidential election therefore a prospective president hillary clinton probably wont suffer too much from secretary of state hillary clintons appalling lapses in judgment

accelerates  april   by david gutierrez natural newsaccording to the most recent report deaths in japan attributable to the  fukushima nuclear disaster have continued to increase last year the number of deaths increased by  over the year beforea march  earthquake and tsunami triggered multiple meltdowns at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant on japans northeast coast in what has become the worst nuclear disaster in history a massive radioactive plume was released by the meltdowns and the crippled plant has continued to leak radiation into the surrounding environment including into the pacific oceana total of about  people were evacuated as a result of the fukushima disaster more fatalities on the horizon according to data collected by the fukushima prefecture  saw  nuclearrelated deaths the two towns with the greatest number of deaths were both near the fukushima plant namie with  dead and tomioka with  deadthe term nuclearrelated means a death that does not result directly from radiation exposure but is caused by a disease later caused by that exposure indeed it is radiationrelated diseases  including cancer tumors and genetic damage  that often cause the bulk of health problems and fatalities in cases of radiation exposureone of the diseases particularly expected to show an uptick after the fukushima disaster is thyroid cancer because radioactive iodine from nuclear disasters tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland an estimated  children contracted thyroid cancer following the chernobyl nuclear disaster it typically takes four to five years for most nuclearrelated thyroid cancers to manifest and as that window approaches many fukushima parents believe that their children are already showing symptoms fukushima officials have tested approximately  children and have turned up  cases of the disease in contrast to the predisaster rate of one or two per million childrenone parent concerned about her childs thyroid cancer risk is megumi muto mutos daughter nana has been diagnosed with lumps in her thyroid gland and the lumps are growing muto is certain that the tumors were caused by nanas exposure to fukushima radiationi feel angry muto said i think the authorities hide the real dangers and now many more children are being diagnosedthe health of both of mutos children has deteriorated after being exposed to the radioactive fallout she saidthey had rashes on their bodies then nose bleeds my sons white cells have decreased and they both have incredible fatigue she said they may not have cancer now but they both have multiple nodules around their thyroids im really worried residents suing government muto and about  other fukushima residents are currently suing the local and national governments alleging that the governments failed to protect their children during the nuclear disasterthis sentiment was echoed in a recent report released by a parliamentary panel which said that the fukushima incident was in part a manmade disaster caused by government regulatory authorities and tokyo electric power company which were all lacking in a sense of responsibility to protect peoples lives and societybecause they do not trust the governments number muto and her fellow plaintiffs have conducted their own tests of the radiation levels in their neighborhoods one test conducted near a school in fukushima city registered radiation levels nearly  times that found in tokyothose levels are high enough to warrant investigation said plaintiff sumio konno who has been a nuclear engineer for  yearsi have to investigate and inform the public of the facts that is why i have become one of the plaintiffs of the court cases konno said theyre still not decontaminating areas where children live or near schools even after four

Mike Adams,2016-11-04T05:25:00.000+02:00,associated press reporter admits faking news stories for hillary clinton stunning admission reveals how ap prints whatever the clintons want facts be damned,"by sarah jones on fri oct th  at  pm matthew miller self described recovering flack from doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within  days of an election share on twitter print this post 
former doj spokesman for eric holder matthew miller a self described recovering flack from doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within  days of an election 
the department and the fbi have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and director comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case miller said on cnn but this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last  days let alone the last  days 
watch here 
miller also held school on twitter about comeys abuse of power which has led to hillary clinton having to defend against a negative i wrote a piece in july on why comeys public comments about clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power  httpstcogcrozqwz 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   he flagrantly violated doj rules with his press conference then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to congress 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   followed by quickly releasing fbi s something they rarely do and which i doubt they will do for future highprofile cases  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   each time he either violated or seriously stretched doj rule  precedent press conference was the original sin  it begat the rest  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   but todays disclosure might be worst abuse yet doj goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   not just public discussion either often wont send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   why because voters have no way to interpret fbidoj activity in a neutral way who is the target of an investigation what conduct  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   this might be totally benign  not even involve clinton but no way for press or voters to know that easy for opponent to make hay over  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   which takes us back to the original rule you dont comment on ongoing investigations then multiply that times ten close to an election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   for whatever reason  there are many theories comey continues to ignore that but only for clinton  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   fbi is undoubtedly investigating links between the russian hack manafort  the trump campaign but arent commenting on it good  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   
miller points out this just smells worse and worse the more we learn linking to this emails were not to or from clinton and appeared like info fbi already had wtf httpstcoysjwfwgzi 
 ken gude kengude october   
the problem with comeys actions isnt that he is investigating hillary clinton the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election it is an established rule that ongoing investigations arent commented on for obvious reasons 
this is quite simply not done comeys reasons for doing this are unclear and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense but its troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rulesagreements of law surrounding the trump campaign which seems to have lowered the bar all around

Mike Rivero,2016-11-02T01:43:00.000+02:00,party corruption clinton campaign directly tied to disgraced dnc consultant,"november   by wire  comments 
patrick henningsen st century wire 
the longer this soap opera drags on its becoming more and more evident that the russian government did not hack into the dnc and moscow is not feeding john podestas emails to wikileaks for those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory this might be a hard pill to swallow 
the white house and the hillary clinton campaign are now married to the idea that putin is hacking the us elections in response the president is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools 
even vp joe biden wants in on the action threatening moscow by sayingwere sending a message we have the capacity to do it 
it seems that where ever you turn nowadays someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia are usrussian relations really that bad or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us 
what was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and cold war holdouts has now infected americas leftwing and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform as evidenced by hillary clintons constant antirussian rhetoric throughout this  election cycle along with the white house clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new antirussia movement 
on july th josh rogin from the washington post wrote the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clintons private email server it should release the emails the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans 
anyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political but then again whos really paying attention these days certainly not the us media 
you can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore antirussian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trumps gop primary success from that point on trumps political opponents saw this as an open target in their words comparing one dictator to another 
never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points president obama got in on the act intensifying the trumpputin narrative to the level of bromance  if youve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin said obama on oct th at a clinton rally in miami 
backed by the obama white house clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia  not only for the controversial dnc leaks but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset in a leading news release entitled  russian hackers targeted arizona election system  we can see how after the cocksure headline the first paragraph would always sound definitive 
hackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state 
but then by the time you advanced down the story the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty 
the bureau described the threat as credible and significant an eight on a scale of one to  matt roberts a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan r said monday as a result reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week 
and then down to almost nothing 
it turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system they had however stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county 
at no point was any evidence ever given only ambiguous statements like cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian governmentdirected hack 
are american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions better yet has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in french bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle its a very depressing prospect and yet this is exactly what we are seeing in this  presidential election 
behind clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks you will find the white house 
on october th the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other highprofile individuals including hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta  giving them to wikileaks 
soon there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon senator ben sasse ner a member of the homeland security committee spouted out russia must face serious consequences moscow orchestrated these hacks because russian president vladimir putin believes sovietstyle aggression is worth it the united states must upend putins calculus with a strong diplomatic political cyber and economic response 
according to a washington post report by technology editor ellen nakashima  the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike  no actual specifics are given so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it 
image crowdstrike cyber security 
the posts nakashima then added 
the administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers 
an online persona calling himself guccifer  has claimed responsibility for posting the material those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts the joint statement said  we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities 
moscows press secretarys reply this is some sort of nonsense said dmitry peskov 
despite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates and as cnns maria cardona said last night no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence  other than speculative guesswork has been presented 
likewise us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that russia did it thus leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date standard washington procedure of ambiguity this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though it seems that the white house hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona  are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe  
still during the final presidential debate hillary clinton proudly crowed how   us intelligence agencies  aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it 
the announcement albeit vague actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence 
we have  intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election said clinton i find that deeply disturbing 
whats even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience the highest levels of the kremlin here are clintons  agencies 
air force intelligence army intelligence central intelligence agency coast guard intelligence defense intelligence agency energy department homeland security department state department treasury department drug enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation marine corps intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency national reconnaissance office national security agency navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence 
what does the coast guard intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podestas emails answer nothing 
the exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july   the us government issued a vague accusatory statement but would not actually name the culprit some might call that propaganda 
in both instances the obama administration refused to present any evidence translated there was no evidence if there had been the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn  none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process if you actually look at the joint dnidhs statement issued on the matter it contains no definitive statement  the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow  the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities according to nsa intelligence workerturned whistleblower william binney  when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled us intelligence worker  
under partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid  the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the trump team with russia reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign to date the fbi havent come up with anything 
to be fair hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings presumably supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community  of course thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans so of course they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks 
for those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now no that was iraq that was bush were not like that no this time its different this time we are sure the russians did it 
in  obama claimed that kims notorious bureau  hacked into sony pictures 
this isnt the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes back in december  obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood pentagoncia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory floating a colorful story that kim jingun had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  bureau   just like with todays russian hack theory no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim and like the russian hack claims the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike  
jumping the shark 
after their democratic party convention on july th the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative 
soon after a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west tom donilon a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly at that point they were in too deep to turn back the biggest impact of wikileaks  shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and trumps refusal to condemn it httpstcoalzpymbb 
 josh schwerin joshschwerin october   
clinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as proof that the kremlin was frontrunning wikileaks email dumps the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on we then watched as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaigns desperate claims it was embarrassing 
they could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails rather than attack assange himself who happens to be popular with millennials the very group clinton struggles to connect with her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead 
either way the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger  the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode because based on the content of both the dnc leaks wikileaks files and project veritas video  their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization 
their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity the results speak for themselves the initial dnc leak of  emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  they revealed the unthinkable the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton sanders never had a chance honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened 
to prove this point both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wassermanschultz a glowing endorsement on the way out for the last eight years chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back this afternoon i called her to let her know that i am grateful said obama not surprisingly clinton thanked wasserman schultz presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership said clinton 
the party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it 
party meltdown 
wasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches  showing how on more than one occasion she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to hillary clinton 
 a march  email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march  town hall with cnns jake tapper 
 a march  email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march  debate hosted by cnn in flint mich source daily caller  
braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here 
 completely corrupt and still brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot 
in addition it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator gloria borger  was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed but no amazingly borger is still leading cnns election coverage 
clearly cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party everunbiased cnns gloria borger refers to being in gop hell and says shell reach out soon to podesta heartwarming podestaemails pictwittercomcqfdcjq 
 lb hacker owens nubianawakening october   
worse than watergate 
perhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the fbis investigation into the clinton foundation yesterday the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue 
some investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president 
theres more it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe the wife of fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  received  in campaign funds in late  for her virginia state senate run this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia govterry mcauliffe  a clinton foundation board member after the funds were donated andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case in normal times this one scandal would be bigger than watergate but these are not normal times  
so why is washington going all out to deflect to russia  and coverup the clinton scandals and the wikileaks document dumps one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the president himself 
what wire reported on oct st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server obama told cbs news on march   that he only found out about clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that 
obama used a pseudonym bobamaameritechnet when communicating with thensecretary of state hillary clinton by email and at least one of those emails ended up on clintons private email server 
so not only did obama lie on national tv but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system who knows why he did it 
sure hes not the first us president to lie but like richard nixon and bill clinton obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the american people 
on top of this any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as  born classified  the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers 
coverup john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet image abc news  
it should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action  that the obama justice department doj is one of the most politicized in history bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case 
on friday fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the clinton email case  currently examining  emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner estranged husband of top clinton aid and longtime confidant huma abedin who was snared in a sexting scandal allegedly involving a underaged female so which doj person is in charge of this investigation none other than assistant attorney general peter j kadzik  who is kadzik zero hedge reports 
oh yes recall our post from last week  clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing  in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clintons benghazi testimony it was peter kadzik 
oh and if that wasnt good enough kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in  when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton internmistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations the two were described as best friends fox news confirms 
fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks 
to call the clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement and on the whole americans are sick of it 
russia  the party scapegoat 
former democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia tweeting ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin 
 howard dean govhowarddean october   
another veteran party operative and lifetime clinton defender james carville  was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused the kgb working with republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on msnbc  
i think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey thats what i think said carville 
maybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb  and that the soviet union actually dissolved in  
these are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the clinton campaign along with the many exposés revealed through wikileaks and the podesta email batches those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks 
suffice to say the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material and also blame donald trump in the process it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised hillary clinton over the finish line on november th the washington establishment has concocted the story that putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the us theyve tried to lay this at the feet of donald trump who obama and clinton claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir putin the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point and antirussian war hawks on the republican side love it too for the white house and the clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre  
the geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold first this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia secondly the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria previously wire reported how washingtons state dept and un delegations led by the dynamic trio of john kerry  samantha power  and john kirby  already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria as we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of usbacked rebels al nusra front or nour aldin alzenki 
with so much at stake geopolitically why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie about 
the demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late  when the us engineered a coup detat in kiev ukraine ever since that its been a goto talking point for ginningup and new transaltlantic arms race as with republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection like clinton and the democrats when the new year rang in  the newly appointed head of the us broadcasting board of governors andrew lack announced the new challenges facing americas own staterun media arm that includes us overseas propaganda assets including voice of america radio free europeradio liberty the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia lack said  we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram he was forced to resign shortly after that 
whats clear is that when it comes to all things russian there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration the list is too long to chronicle here although  russianbacked rebles shootting down mh  and  assad regime sarin attack in damascus in   certainly comes to mind 
that said its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government a world nuclear power and member of the unsc of hacking into the us electoral process when you examine history however what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped  foreign elections throughout history the attempted assassination of over  foreign leaders  knowing all this one might find it hard to take seriously washingtons claims that putin and trump are trying manipulate the  election 
on oct   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table 
we have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of us policy towards russia its not just a rhetorical russophobia but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security 
selfserving career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the obamaclinton era 
knowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone anywhere  if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from maybe they could start there far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry 
still were waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in washington  before its too late

the latest batch of the podesta emails shared by wikileaks add a darker dimension if it was even possible to the sordid culture of corruption lies and depravity that surrounds hillary clinton explaining why the fbi has been calling her for quite some time now the antichrist personified  
it is a possibility that hellarys clique attends and organizes satanic rituals involving mockup scenes of cannibalism and sexual abuse involving children 
one of the emails directed at tony podesta john podestas brother contains the following sentence 

i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place 
do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining 
this really does not sounds like much until you discover the author of this invitation she who walks in the footsteps of the beast 
this is the woman who sent the email marina abramovic dressed in red and holding the skinned head of a dead goat a clear reference to the occult character baphomet 
there is proof that the clinton foundation directly transferred abramovic ten thousand dollars in at least one instance for her services abramovic carving a pentagram in the flesh of her stomach with a blade to show her artistic side 
a selfproclaimed artist abramovic hails from serbia and regularly organizes performances and events using what she calls spirit cooking 
this spirit cooking includes mixing semen breast milk urine or fresh blood before consuming it or splattering it over various things such as lifesized representations of young children like shown below 
this performance included spelling with the body fluids the following stanza 
with a sharp 
knife cut deeply into the 
middle finger of your 
left hand 
eat the pain 
other examples of her art nowadays any revolting expression of bad taste if sporting the correct pair of problem glasses include public dinners where politicians hollywood stars singers and decision makers gather to eat cakes that depict a naked human corpse or feast on the fake i hope by all that is sacred blood contained in a coffin where swims another human body celebrities that use demonic symbols in their persona such as lady gaga rush to participate to abramovics events another heavy user of the occult symbols jayz is a big fan of marina 
these codes are all directly copied from rituals such as black masses or sabat night reunions and popularized by figures such as aleister crowley from whom abramovic draws direct inspiration 
it is part of this growing phenomenon where the elites and celebrities close to power get caught intentionally or not showing symbols celebrating the ancient babylonian rites or the worship of the devil on november the th clinton chose jayz in a last bid to draw crowds to her empty rallies coincidence innocent children involved in that mess 
there is hard evidence that bill clinton traveled at least  times sometimes without his bodyguards it is all in the pilot logs to billionaire and convicted pedophile jeffrey epsteins island on board his plane dubbed the lolita express as it is in this plane that the guests could allegedly have sex with minors 
with this in mind it is disturbing to notice that other podesta emails refer to children as being the entertainment at pool parties almost entirely attended by middleaged men involved in politics other emails involve strange references to food such as pizza cheese  worth of hot dogs for a party that attendees dream of and recipes that many sources suggest are code words for orgies involving minors and extremely young children you can read more about it here  the whole clinton bag of crooks reeks of unnatural sexual behaviour and reproachable acts and we will certainly know much more in the days to come as hillary clinton is still under fbi investigation as we speak this follows the scandal surrounding huma abedin clintons right hand and confidant and her estranged husband sex offender and champion onehanded texter anthony weiner it will take some time before they go through weiners  emails and decide of a course of action regarding these dark revelations and other atrocities of the clinton crime family la plus belle ruse du diable est de vous persuader quil nexiste pas drawing by ben garrison 
these heavy accusations of satanism remind us of the sexual blackmail practices said to take place among the popular hiphop and hollywood communities as roosh described in his related article  or other rumours linked to suspicious reunions involving the secret ceremonies of the elite such as the ones of the bohemian grove or the rothschilds parties of the s 
if those recent speculations turn out to be true it could have the effect of a bomb and mean a revolution 
observe the symbols of cannibalism eerily similar in the three following pictures those are respectively a scene of the rothschilds surrealistic bal a painting hanging in john podestas office and one of abramovics dinners 
i will let you be the own judge of the conclusions inspired by those images my father is a very cartesian fellow and a saying of his comes to mind 
just like saint thomas

no matter how you feel about zoos this story will make you feel good 
zoo administrators are always experimenting with ways to make their animals caged experiences as accommodating to their needs as possible with varying degrees of success but thanks to an innovative and humane new initiative one of our most beloved institutions is setting a new standard for animal rights the san diego zoo has taped telescopes to all of their animals heads so that they can look at the planets 
what a tremendous step forward 
for decades the san diego zoo led the way in terms of tourist attractions but this latest move proves that they are even more committed to treating their animals with dignity with a telescope affixed to each animals head these incredible creatures can now gaze at the planets just by looking up visitors can take great comfort knowing that the ostriches chinchillas and all other animals are no longer limited to just looking at trees dirt or clouds as they had been for so many heartbreaking years 
according to president and ceo douglas myers the project directly addresses a basic right of all animals 
when you consider the challenges we face when improving animal captivity strapping a telescope snugly to each animals head is a nobrainer said myers these are beautiful creatures that deserve to look at the planets 
indeed most zoo animals have never had the ability to take in the wonders of our galaxy but in san diego its now a key part of every animals care plan at any moment an otter can swivel his head and take a look at saturn a zebra can glance up from grazing to observe a sea of constellations seemingly close enough to lick and when the park welcomed a new fox last month tourists were able to watch as zoologists strapped a tiny telescope to his head equipped with a polarized filter to protect his sensitive eyes 
wow 
well if you needed another reason to finally visit the san diego zoo youve officially got it hopefully this will encourage zoos everywhere to continue to explore new ways to address the welfare of their animals thankfully they now have an excellent place to start",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3463/5/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,0.0,life thirdgraders saw classmate didnt lunch kept feeding lunches clogged door got school canceled,email matter feel zoos story make feel good zoo administrators always experimenting ways make animals caged experiences accommodating needs possible varying degrees success thanks innovative humane new initiative one beloved institutions setting new standard animal rights san diego zoo taped telescopes animals heads look planets tremendous step forward decades san diego zoo led way terms tourist attractions latest move proves even committed treating animals dignity telescope affixed animals head incredible creatures gaze planets looking visitors take great comfort knowing ostriches chinchillas animals longer limited looking trees dirt clouds many heartbreaking years according president ceo douglas myers project directly addresses basic right animals consider challenges face improving animal captivity strapping telescope snugly animals head nobrainer said myers beautiful creatures deserve look planets indeed zoo animals never ability take wonders galaxy san diego key part every animals care plan moment otter swivel head take look saturn zebra glance grazing observe sea constellations seemingly close enough lick park welcomed new fox last month tourists able watch zoologists strapped tiny telescope head equipped polarized filter protect sensitive eyes wow well needed another reason finally visit san diego zoo youve officially got hopefully encourage zoos everywhere continue explore new ways address welfare animals thankfully excellent place start,1.0

a top official in tehran has accused european government of failing to take the required measures to facilitate trade agreements with iran  what he says is already in violation of a nuclear agreement that was sealed with the country last summer and came into effect in january 
asghar fakhrieh kashan irans deputy minister of roads and urban development told the financial times that european government should prevent the inclusion of what he described as very exceptional terms and conditions in trade agreements with iran 
fakhrieh kashan warned that such terms and conditions were effectively discouraging investments in the iranian economy 
he said export credit agencies were specifically demanding premiums on insurance that made banks insist on putting what he described as unacceptable terms in contracts related to political risk in doing business with iran 
fakhrieh kashan emphasized that iran will not accept any clauses in trade agreements which he said foresee such possibilities like snapback sanctions and new sanctions against iran 
european businesses he said are in fact trying to devise deals in which political risks are inserted alongside commercial risks  what he said is totally rejected by the islamic republic 
if anyone needed guarantees against political risks it was iran fakhrieh kashan said in reference to the impact of western sanctions on the iranian economy 
why should iran accept very exceptional terms and conditions in its contracts with european companies this is not called a normal relationship he said 
fakhrieh kashan emphasized that european countries should take the adequate measures to prevent their businesses from including political risk in contracts warning that any failure to do so will be against the nuclear agreement with iran 
this is where european countries are failing to be committed to the nuclear agreement one of the main reasons the signing of contracts in various sectors has been delayed is this issue 
last summer iran signed a historic deal with the us britain france russia china and germany  the socalled p group  based on which it agreed to restrict certain aspects of its nuclear energy activities the p in return agreed to lift certain economic sanctions imposed against the islamic republic loading",english,presstv.ir,http://media.presstv.com/photo/20161027/e7f303d5-ab26-41ea-b5cf-f9f92625bfec.jpg,state,1.0,indian princess watches rare paleontological remains,eu refugees wait disembark ship october palermo italy photo afp refugees died across world since beginning says international organization migration iom organization based geneva said friday total deaths people died trying cross mediterranean sea boat indicating person increase compared wednesday united nations high commissioner refugees unhcr made different account deaths mediterranean since january also noting new record compared asylum seekers trying reach european union died libyan shores recently according iom eu said thursday begun training libyan coast guard curb influx asylum seekers today starting training libyan coast guard operation sophia important step said eu foreign affairs chief federica mogherini arrived meeting nato defense ministers brussels nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said western military alliance launched operation sea guardian mediterranean help support operation sophia eu launched operation sophia last year hundreds asylum seekers died rickety boats sank southern italy central mediterranean route seen asylum seekers risk lives recent months eu reached accord turkey march halt influx refugees crossing aegean reach europe stoltenberg said within two weeks ships aircraft would provided nato allies help back operation sophia loading,1.0

admin,2016-10-27T17:45:16.623+03:00,dying out wild animal numbers could fall by  from  study says,"a subject not often discussed is the topic of how to repair strained or broken relationships it is one that comes up in everyones life so it will be useful to make a few suggestions about it here we will talk about relationships from friends family and lovers
relationships among friends we will treat first the first step in this process is to make an evaluation to determine whether the relationship is worth saving or rehabilitating it is a simple fact of life that some relationships have an expiration date when two people no longer have anything in common or their paths take them in divergent directions it may be difficult to find common ground in this situation it is always better to let the relationship die a natural death slowly rather than rapidly abrupt terminations may leave the other party with negative feelings and this should be avoided if at all possible
there are some instances where repair is not possible when someone has committed a fundamental violation of trust or respect this is a warning sign that the person was never a friend in the first place another point to keep in mind is that repair of a broken relationship requiresno demandsthe participation of both parties if the other person is unwilling to participate in the process then your efforts will be futile and will come to nothing

once we have determined that the friendship is worth repairing or sustaining the next step is to decide how to make the first approach to the other party in this we must try to evaluate the reasons for the problems in the first place we should make an honest assessment about how things got to where they are did someone say or do something that caused hard feelings on the other side was there some intervening cause that made the two parties diverge in plans and activities these types of questions must be honestly and repeatedly asked we have a tendency to minimize our own hurtful actions and exaggerate those of others and this must be kept in mind
the key rule at this point is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of the other party we must try to see things from our friends perspective for many people this can be difficult as it involves getting past our own feelings of hurt or rejection and into the shoes of the other person and yet it is essential very frequently the reasons for strained or broken friendships lies in the fact that there is some problem going on in the other persons life only by being a perceptive student of human nature can we divine the cause sometimes the only thing that caused the strained relationship was some misunderstanding that was easily curable
keep in mind that we must tryat least in our own mindsto discover the source of the other persons problem this is not always possible as human beings are not always rational but we can at least make the effort i remember in the film hoffa that there was a great line from jack nicholson he told one of his men real problems real grievances can be resolved they can be negotiated but imaginary grievances that man is going to hate you for life i have no idea if jimmy hoffa every actually said this but it sounds like something he would have said he meant that we should avoid hurting the pride of our friends we should be acutely aware how it is sometimes the intangible slights that can most rankle with a man
when you have decided to make the first step it is always better to initiate contact directly do not wait for the other person to do it depending on the circumstances this should be done discreetly and without too much in the way of overpowering insistence there is a certain type of finesse that a man should have at critical times and this is one of them the approach should be direct but neither insistent nor demanding a fish is best hooked with a lure gently laid
of vital importance here is that the approach be sincere one should genuinely want to contact the other party sincerity is the glue that binds friendships together and permits their longevity there should be no hypocrisy or falsity in any of our dealings with friends this kind of thing is immediately apparent and once detected its whiff surrounds the offending party like a permanent cloud if the other party is receptive to the approach we can then gradually feel our way forward taking care to avoid the reasons why the friendship became strained in the first place things may never quite go back to what they were but at least we can find solid ground for a new frame of reference
two examples will suffice here the historian william shirer worked closely with famed correspondent edward r murrow when the two were in germany in the s yet after the war was over the two grew apart shirers account of the estrangement suggests that he was repelled by murrows enthusiastic adoption of the anticommunist hysteria of the time shirer found himself gradually blackballed from most major news networks before being forced out completely he broke with murrow over these events many decades later he approached murrow all venom spent the two were able to find common ground again

another example makes the same point theodore roosevelt was a strongwilled insistent man to say the least he was in a position to choose his successor as president and to this end he selected a man very different from him the affable and rotund william howard taft taft eventually began to find roosevelt an overbearing and unwelcome presence in his life the two men eventually broke completely a result of their personality differences and different conceptions of leadership to his credit roosevelt eventually approached his old friend privately to patch things up they were never the same of course but at least some cordiality was restored
relationships with family are of a fundamentally different sort because we are linked by bonds of blood or perhaps marriage it will be more difficult to disentangle ourselves from those with whom we have become estranged on the other hand it may be easier to repair such grievances or at least find common ground since there may be more shared experiences with the other party that act in our favor the key here is not to expect too much although shared history and common blood may work in our favor they can be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that irrational family antagonisms can run deeper than those from strained friendships patience and persistence are most important here perhaps more so than friendships with those unrelated to us

repairing strained relationships with lovers is perhaps the most difficult when a man and woman have been united in the past through the coital act an entirely different set of emotions and motivations come into play relationships between lovers can fail or become strained for an infinite number of reasons and it would be impossible to discuss all of them here it is enough for me to state my opinion that it is nearly impossible to bring an intimate sexual relationship back to what it was after it has been broken
strained is one thing broken is quite another my own experience leads me to believe that once a sexual relationship is done it is done one cannot really go back to what it was before amicable dealings are certainly possible and happen all the time but i would not call this friendship i would call it an uneasy equilibrium loves inflammatory presence scorches all it leaves in its wake

Alex Ansary,2016-11-02T18:36:20.940+02:00,china airport security robot gives electroshocks,"suspect captured in ambushstyle killings of two iowa cops  
usa today 
authorities captured a yearold male suspect without incident wednesday hours after an earlymorning ambushstyle killing of two police officers in the des moines metro area 
the suspect in the backtoback killings was identified as scott michael greene said urbandale police spokesman sgt chad underwood before capturing him police had described greene who was last seen driving a blue ford f with an iowa license plate as armed and dangerous 
greene was taken into custody by the dallas county sheriffs department while walking along a rural road in redfield about  miles west of where the shootings occurred 
according to police greene flagged down a passing department of natural resources officer handed over his id and told the officer to call police no shots were fired and there was no struggle according to police 
the suspect was taken by ambulance to a des moines hospital with an unknown injury 
in a late morning news conference police identified the slain officers as urbandale police officer justin martin and des moines police sgt anthony tony beminio 
the attacks began around  am ct when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire at the intersection of th street and aurora avenue in urbandale 
the first officers arriving on the scene found martin fatally wounded about  minutes later some two miles away beminio was was shot near the intersection of merle hay road and sheridan ave while responding to reports of the first officers shooting beminio was transported to iowa methodist medical center where he died scott michael greene photo des moines police 
both officers were gunned down in their patrol cars 
it doesnt look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is that shot them while they sat in their cars a visibly emotional parizek told reporters 
in all appearances it looks  that these officers were ambushed he added officer from des moines and another from urbandale were shot and killed in their cars dmpolice said officersdown 
 daniel p finney newsmanone november   
des moines police fearing officers were being singled out paired up its patrol officers so none were on the street alone parizek said 
theres literally a clear and present danger if youre a police officer he said 
police did not offer many details on how investigators identified greene as a suspect underwood said he was identified through a series of leads and a series of investigative tips 
as of an earlymorning news conference police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers and planned to withhold the officers names years of service and other details until later in the day parizek said 
attorney general loretta lynch condemned the killings saying violence has no place in the united states of america 
let me be clear there is no message in murder the attorney general said referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country violence creates nothing it only destroys a des moines police officer was found fatally shot in a vehicle near the intersection of merle hay road and sheridan avenue in des moines on wednesday nov   photo brian powers the des moines register 
its the first time des moines has seen a police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in  
two des moines officers susan farrell and carlos puentemorales died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck headon by a wrongway drunk driver 
the killing of the urbandale officer appeared to be the citys first for an officer shot in the line of duty underwood said at the news conference 
parizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost farrell and puentemorales as well as with this tragedy 
i dont even know where to begin on how bad this year is he said but this is what we do we come in day in and day out we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of whats going on in our personal and professional lives officers investigate the scene at merle hay and sheridan ave where an officer was found shot at about  am on on wednesday nov   in urbandale 
in a statement iowa gov terry branstad called the attack on the officers an attack on the public safety of all iowans 
we call on iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice he said our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harms way 
iowa sen joni ernst extended her thoughts and prayers to the families of the officers killed 
although the investigation is still unfolding what appears to be an ambush attack of police in the line of duty is an attack on the community at large and all of the men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us ernst said this was a senseless act of violence and it cannot be tolerated

Jason Easley,2016-10-28T02:50:18.388+03:00,bernie sanders says what the media wont trump is a gutless political coward,"by sarah jones on sun oct th  at  pm senator harry reid dropped the bomb that the fbi and national security experts possess explosive information about ties and coordination between russia and donald trump and his campaign share on twitter print this post 
talk about burying the lede 
in senator harry reids letter in which he suggests that fbi director james comey may have broken the law the hatch law he also drops the bomb that the fbi and national security experts possess explosive information about ties and coordination between russia and donald trump and his campaign 
reid writes in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump his top advisors and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states which trump praises at every opportunity 
reid points out the disturbing double standard in comeys treatment of sensitive information between the two parties with a clear intent to aid one over the other 
if the fbi and national security experts have information that donald trump and or his campaign are colluding or collaborating to bring about a particular result regarding the us election or our foreign policy stances this is an emergency 
which issue is so much of an emergency that a federal official might consider dropping the bomb just  days before an election electing someone who is conspiring with russia or electing someone whose aide may have sent an email she forget to tell everyone about 
the double standard is not only troubling at this point but dangerous 
bomb dropped 
everyone already suspected trumps ties to russia and his campaign has been full of ties to the kremlin but now reid has confirmed information about coordination between trump and russia 
now that ladies and gentlemen is an october shocker 
reids full letter follows 
dear director comey 
your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election through your partisan actions you may have broken the law 
the double standard established by your actions is clear 
in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump his top advisors and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states which trump praises at every opportunity the public has a right to know this information i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public there is no danger to american interests from releasing it and yet you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information 
by contrast as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible 
moreover in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election despite the fact that for all you know the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton 
as you know a memo authored by deputy attorney general sally yates on march   makes clear that all justice department employees including you are subject to the hatch act the memo defines the political activity prohibited under the hatch act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group 
the clear doublestandard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information along with your timing was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group 
please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant 
with the deepest regret i now see that i was wrong 
sincerely

Beau Albrecht,2016-10-26T23:04:39.175+03:00,how a communist brainwashing method was exported to the united states,"a favorite trope of feminists and women claiming workplace discrimination is that female staff are the victims of sexism due to judgments about their appearance but how many times have we all seen girls working in our building or out on their lunch breaks in attire more befitting of a tinder date raunchy nightclub strip joint or even the gym meanwhile men must keep their fashion within a very narrow range of acceptability otherwise they risk failing to get that fancy new job or could lose their current one
furthermore guys learn to deal with the fact that the world does judge you based on your appearance many women have zero idea about this concept only accepting the judgments they agree with or those ones that further their interests and career for those opinions they dont like they can always conveniently claim the person giving them is sexist or misogynist or just as amorphously objectifying a woman this is classic attentionseeking

the epitome of this growing female narcissism is a british woman by the name of jayde phoenix  touting herself as a it security expert despite her academic and job credentials being a fraction of what it means to be highly qualified or plain nonexistent she suggested a guess the number of usbs in a jar competition to promote her company with her breasts nearly spilling out of a seethrough top she looked at the camera with a lustful gaze what many on the roosh v forum would call a thousand cock stare her clothes and demeanor better suited a street hooker than a professional
as we should have expected in our troubled times the many critics of phoenixs contrived appearance were labeled as sexists bullies and misogynists she herself tried to excoriate her detractors emphasizing how good she was at her job and the professional standards she supposedly meets every day but there are a few questions both the original photo exercise and her subsequent justifications failed to answer namely
if shes so good at her job why did she need to use a seethrough bra in the picture why doesnt she wear a top size that comfortably contains her breasts rather than flaunting them why is she and not someone else in the photo though the attentionseeking of jayde and her employer first flared up several months ago the dilemma of girls like her is an ongoing one
try getting employed in an office as a man with this sort of attire baggy pants with your underwear showing 
the male office worker could be wearing black pants and not jeans like in the photo and sporting a typical business shirt that doesnt matter no white collar company worth a dime is going to hire a man whose boxers or briefs are showing down to his ass compare this to the parade of female office workers who go beyond showing their arms and the hint of a bra strap to exhibiting half the surface area of their breasts in addition if you havent already noticed the very short crop top is now a staple garment within american office unculture it is not unusual to see a large part of a womans bare stomach and back including overthetop tattoos
hawaiian shirts and board shorts 
some workplaces most notably those trying to appear hip have drastically relaxed the need for business attire but these employers are definitely in the minority a man with a penchant for hawaiian shirts board shirts or other beach clothing will find his career options drastically limited as they should be the way in which you relate to your friends or fellow tourists on a holiday is almost always far different from how you should deal with clients investors stakeholders and the like in your profession men save their best or worst hawaiian shirt for office charity fundraising days company summer parties and related functions not an average day
leather lycra or ridiculously tight clothing in general 
inasmuch as tight clothing on men doesnt tickle your or my fancy its how ironic how an obese woman can wear garments twice or thrice as closefitting in the workplace than a fit male and male office workers of the world dont even consider wearing leather pants during your next boardroom presentation the occasional gay man or metrosexual might escape sanction for some outlandish or garish outfit but most industries if they value their reputation with clients will prohibit you from donning clothing that looks like it came from the wardrobe of lance armstrong or someone from queer eye for the straight guy 
excuses for female attentionseeking are out of control it seems that lady victoria hervey and jayde phoenix read the same book
there is little doubt that jayde phoenixs employer expected a backlash against her in this sense it was a very good marketing and advertising ploy for those prospective clients who do not care about actual professionalism of which there are many as for phoenix and other women like her this situation is winwin at the very least she and those of her ilk can continue their daytoday objectification of themselves generating desperately craved male attention in particular even for girls who do not receive the publics spotlight any roadblock or mishap in their career can later be blamed on misogyny after judgments about their appearance
at best as happened in phoenixs situation she gets nationwide and even global coverage for narcissistic girls who take zero responsibility for how others may negatively perceive them this is the coup of a lifetime yet as they age and jayde phoenix looks far older than her early s expect their antics to become more strawclutching and while these girls engage in sexual selfadvancement and wage war over imaginary discriminations the vast majority of male employees have no scapegoat they can use to rationalize their failures and virtually no means of combating institutionalized prejudice against their socalled privilege
by the way is jayde phoenixs arabic necklace indicative of some work she may have done in dubai

Kyle Trouble,2016-11-08T18:01:22.038+02:00,things to know about prague czech republic,"what motivates you to live what is the meaning of life
for centuries mankind has questioned everything mankinds quest for the answer to what drives us and what pushes us forward in times of darkness is not exempt from analysis in fact its been a consistent theme since the dawn of time stoicism  although not directly attributed to answering what drives us skirts around the topic and creates a general set of principles to help us deal with negative externalities in life
while many philosophers have pontificated on the subject of mankinds driving force and the will to live theres a problem inherent with such an analysis in order to research such a basic and instinctual topic one needs to experience a visceral cerebral experience that brings him or her to a basic instinctual level before having such an epiphany one needs to examine our animalistic base and then explore logically from there
one such analysis is known as logotherapy from the greek word logoswise  logotherapy developed by viktor frankl is an influential school of psychotherapy that is founded on the pillars of what motivates mankind before we delve into logotherapy however its important that we discuss viktor franklwho he was and why his unique perspective provides for an incredibly powerful source of credibility and authority

viktor frankl was born in  in what was at that time known as austriahungary frankl was a neurologist and psychiatrist his early life was relatively unspectacular but from an early age he displayed an interest in philosophy as well as psychotherapy initially interested in freud and adlers work he began to see their faults and eventually diverged from their teachingsbecoming particularly interested in depression as well as suicide
during  frankl in completing his residency in neurology was responsible for setting up the selbstmörderpavillon  translated in english to the suicide pavilion its estimated that frankl along with his staff treated upwards of  women who had suicidal tendencies
in september of  his life was shaken frankl along with his wife and family were deported to a nazi concentration camp known as theresienstadt ghetto whilst there and during his stay at auschwitz frankl worked as a doctor in the psychiatric care unit focusing on mental health helping newcomers deal with shock and grief

in  after three years in a concentration camp frankl released his book entitled mans search for meaning  which details his experiences as a holocaust survivor as well as his theory which became known as logotherapy the book is divided into two partspart one is a detailed account of his experiences whereas part two discusses logotherapy
his time in the numerous concentration camps began to shape his philosophical and psychiatric theory while he had read books on the subject of psychological healing prior to his imprisonment he had never experienced it to the degree in which he had become accustomed to particularly intrigued as to why some prisoners lived longer than others frankl began to organize his thoughts and document how the average prisoners life in a concentration camp was reflected in their mind as a doctor focusing on grief and shockstricken inmates he was in a very unique position
hundreds and during some weeks thousands of helpless inmates were carted in auschwitz the mostfeared concentration camp weekly between the inmates sleeping next to him and those seeking treatment frankl noted that each prisoner without exception faced three stages of psychological reactions once entering the concentration camp these stages were shock apathy and depersonalization
while seemingly unimportant the noted documentation of these stages was very important for frankl as he began to notice while every inmate experienced these stages some experienced them to a less cerebral degree some inmates seemed less depressive than others and featured a happier disposition these inmateswith some expected variabilityoutlived the other inmates
discovery as he began to poke and prod frankl noticed something that separated these individuals from others hope there is never not meaning in life every moment no matter how painful dehumanizing or horrendous it is has meaning by extension frankl suggests even suffering is meaningful the inmates that survived the longestthe ones that outlived the rest had hope frankl suggested that he could tell whether or not an inmate would live just by looking at their facesthe face of a dejected depressed inmate was obvious and clear as day without hope they were doomed
everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way
the next question that frankl sought to answer was an important one and the foundational maxim of logotherapywhy did some men have hope and others not
the answer was love
the truth  that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire then i grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart the salvation of man is through love and in love i understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved
frankl in his book mans search for meaning recounted several instances where he would be driven into brief stints of depression after a beating during a latenight march in bare feet or watching his friend get treated inhumanely hed vacillate from depression by thinking and longing for his wife the men whom lasted the longest invariably had a wife or a job that they loved it was this motivator the unquantifiable love that pushed men in inhuman circumstances to existentially escape the physical realm and put mind above body
what we can get from this to answer this frankl codified three ways that he discovered is how we can find meaning in life  a job love and how we react to suffering its important to realize that while its easy to read this and assume that frankl is saying we should all suffer in order to find meaninghes not he is suggesting however that should we not have a jobdeed or love that allow us to find meaning in life we can still find meaning by choosing how to react in a negative situationour mental freedom is one of the only things that can never be taken from us theoretically speaking
the average man will never be faced with such a dire circumstance such as the atrocities that frankl and so many others dealt with what we can do however is choose how we react to lifes adversities
a fair assessment of logotherapy is that it provides a simplistic solution to a complex question life since life is such a complex series of events logotherapy offers a solution that may not be representative of lifes true hardships and intricacies in saying this my own personal evaluation is that this criticism in itself may have flaws by assuming that a complex question must have a complex solution even the assumption that life in complex can be debated its a cliched saying that life is hard or complexand even if it is its not out of the realm of possibility that a complex question has a simple solution  sometimes the answer we seek is right in front of us
viktor frankl died in september  and his works are still read today several logotherapy institutes exist today named after him

Jason Easley,2016-10-27T01:34:56.745+03:00,three new polls shatter the myth that the presidential election is tightening,"share on twitter print this post 
the fbi is examining how a hillary clinton aide handled emails the examination has nothing to do with the democratic nominee her emails or her email server 
according to newsweeks kurt eichenwald the scandal is related to the process clinton aide huma abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read 
eichenwald reported because clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent abedin like many state department officials found the government network technology to be cumbersome and she had great trouble printing documents there investigative records show as a result she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified state department account to either her yahoo account or her account on clintons server and printed the emails from there it is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husbands campaign 
abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed clinton needed to see and when the secretary forwarded emails to her for printing abedin told the fbi she would often print these emails without reading them abedin printed a large number of emails this way in part because investigative records show other staff members considered her clintons gatekeeper and often sent abedin electronic communications they wanted the secretary to see 
the entire scandal is about how emails were printed it has nothing to do with how hillary clinton handled emails or classified information the investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for hillary clinton to read no wonder comey didnt provide more details in his letter to congress the details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the fbi 
there is no evidence that clintons aide committed a crime for the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal there must be evidence that abedin intended to leak classified information there remains zero evidence of criminal activity 
the fbi examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the  election  and comeys behavior is a disgrace to the us intelligence community 
the new information destroys republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat  republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat 
the emails wont change anything in  but they will give congressional republicans a reason to keep investigating hillary clinton in  and beyond in other words james comey is already delegitimizing

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-01T13:09:42.688+02:00,time investigating hillary is an attack on all women,"lawyer who kept hillary campaign chief out of jail in doj hillary probe november   daniel greenfield 
peter kadzik kept hillarys campaign chief out of jail and he hopes to do the same for her 
hillarys people have gone on the warpath against the fbi their allies are obamas political appointees at the doj and this is who is in their corner 
the justice department official in charge of informing congress about the newly reactivated hillary clinton email probe is a political appointee and former privatepractice lawyer who kept clinton campaign chairman john podesta out of jail lobbied for a tax cheat later pardoned by president bill clinton and led the effort to confirm attorney general loretta lynch 
peter kadzik who was confirmed as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in june  represented podesta in  when independent counsel kenneth starr was investigating podesta for his possible role in helping exbill clinton intern and mistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations 
fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks 
kadziks name has surfaced multiple times in regard to the fbis investigation of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton for using a private homebrewed server after fbi director james comey informed congress on thursday the fbi was reviving its inquiry when new evidence linked to a separate investigation was discovered congressional leaders wrote to the department of justice seeking more information kadzik replied 
we assure you that the department will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible kadzik wrote on oct

Henry Wolff,2016-10-29T04:39:08.112+03:00,ers fans care more about victories than kaepernick,"dutch antiislam mp wilders to snub hate speech trial afp october   
defiant dutch antiislam politician geert wilders said friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for  elections 
the trial opens on monday before a threejudge bench with the farright politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about moroccans living in the netherlands 
it is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country wilders said in a statement friday dubbing the case a political trial in which i refuse to cooperate 
it comes as opinion polls have shown his farright freedom party pvv doing well ahead of march elections 
after riding high amid the migrant crisis the party is now polling neckandneck with prime minister mark ruttes liberals each predicted to win between  to  seats in the seat parliament 
set to last until november  the trial focuses on a comment made at a march  rally when wilders asked supporters if they wanted fewer or more moroccans in your city and in the netherlands 
when the crowd shouted back fewer fewer wilders answered were going to organise that 
snip 
wilders said friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer geertjan knoops and instead go to work in the parliament in the hague 
snip 
judges earlier this month dismissed arguments by wilders lawyers that the trial was politically motivated adding they did not believe it will impact the pvvs election campaign 
politicians are granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position the judges ruled last month 
precisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements 
wilders hit back friday saying it is a travesty that i have to stand trial because i spoke about fewer moroccans 
millions of dutch citizens  percent of the population want fewer moroccans he claimed 
not because they despise all moroccans or want all moroccans out of the country but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many moroccans

orangutans orangutans are among a special group of animals with mating rituals based around the lunar cycle meaning that whenever a full moon is in the sky male orangutans will climb the tallest tree and try to have sex with the moon only settling for a female orangutan once they grow tired of stretching their penises outward so they might touch the moon with it 
armadillos in the armadillos song the male armadillos penis makes an annoying highpitched whirring sound until a female armadillo is so annoyed by it that she silences it by having sex with him 
alligators during mating season male alligators stand upright and walk around on their hind legs and place their arms on their hips and sometimes even ride bikes until a female alligator gets horny from watching them 
beavers the male beaver and female beaver each recite a fun fact about beavers taking a step closer to one another as they do so at some point they get so close that theyre actually mating 
elephants before having sex the female elephant will coat her male partner in sticky boiling hot pepsi that only comes out of her trunk when shes in the mood 
iguanas when it is time for iguanas to mate the male iguana climbs on top of a female fox and the female iguana climbs on top of a male fox the two iguanas ride their foxes straight at each other at full speed and when the foxes collide with each other the iguanas are flung forward and collide in midair as they fly through the air the male iguana impregnates the female iguana who sprays eggs in all directions as she hurtles haphazardly toward the sky when the mating ritual is complete both iguanas hit the ground and die

  by vicki batts tags weight lifting  dementia  brain health naturalnews there are many reasons to partake in strength training weightbaring exercises are known for their health benefits but could lifting weights also boost your brain recent research indicates that may just be the caseto begin the study researchers asked a group of people aged  to  to engage in a mix of weight lifting and brain training exercises all of the people who partook in the study had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment which is a precursor to alzheimers disease  and is an early sign of dementiawhile this particular study did not examine whether the benefits of exercise could be extended to the general population the results were quite impressive published in the journal of the american geriatrics society  the study found that weightbaring exercises could indeed provide some brain benefits the researchers found a casual relationship between an increase in muscle strength and an increase in brain function on that basis the team recommended that more people begin a strength training regime so that the worlds aging population can hopefully be a little healthier it is currently projected that about  million people will have dementia by the year the same team behind this most recent research also published a paper in  that revealed that weight training provided cognitive benefits to just about every area of the brain  something cognitive training failed to dowhile discussing their most recent data one of the studys researchers dr yorgi mavros of sydney university commented what we found in this followup study is that the improvement in cognition function was related to their muscle strength gains the stronger people became the greater the benefit for their brainfor the strength training study participants were asked to lift weights that were equivalent to about  percent of their maximum capacity twice a week for six months  similar to the way in which many athletes train and as the participants got stronger the amount of weight they lifted went up as well in order to maintain the desired  percent of their maximum effortbrain scans revealed that certain regions of the brain actually increased in size for those who took part in the exercise regime dr mavros says that the benefits were profound enough to warrant recommending weight training for everyonethe more we can get people doing resistance training like weight lifting  the more likely we are to have a healthier ageing population he told the independent  dr mavros also added that the best way to ensure that you get the most benefit from exercise is by maintaining a regular routine exercising frequently and with some intensity is key to getting the most out of what youre doingthis new research is not the first to suggest that exercise can provide benefits to brain health  the body of research linking physical exercise to better cognitive function has only continued to grow over the last several years science has indicated that in addition to better mental health exercise can also promote both better memory and concentrationdr james pickett head of research at the alzheimers society also had a few things to say about this new study he noted new research is beginning to unravel how physical exercise may have benefits for the brain as people get older this study suggests that people with minor memory and thinking problems known as mild cognitive impairment may benefit from weight training to improve their brain healthpickett also noted that while it is not yet clear if exercise can reverse dementia they do know that it is one of the most important factors in its prevention along with being active he says that not smoking and eating a healthy balanced diet are all

by twain yobra 
posted tuesday november   at pm edt 
joint pain prevents us from exercising or doing simple tasks like walking unfortunately it only gets worse as we age this happens because the fluid synovial fluid in the joints reduces as we age reduction of this fluid increases friction on the joints and leads to arthritis 
but research also shows that uric acid can cause arthritis buildup of uric acid in the joints can damage joint tissues and cause pain the buildup happens when the kidneys dont excrete enough uric acid it can also be triggered by the body converting purines to uric acid fast longterm buildup of uric acid can cause inflammation and reduce your mobility 
switch to an alkaline diet 
theres been a neverending argument about whether alkaline diets reduce acidity in the body or not in fact some experts have discredited them as useless but what does research say well this study found that alkaline diet enhances excretion of uric acid through urine on the other hand researchers found that acidic foods reduce excretion of uric acid 
another study affirms that alkaline diets can help reduce uric acid in the body and they can prevent uric acid crystallization in joints 
note that more research needs to be conducted on effect of diet on uric acid crystal 
eat these alkaline foods 
you simply need to reduce intake of acidic foods and eat more alkaline foods alkaline foods are mostly vegetables and legumes red pepper",english,naturalnews.com,http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Vitamin-B12-foods.jpg,junksci,0.0,alkaline water kills cancer make,ad hbs account httpblogsnaturalnewscombiblicalbeginnings hesh goldstein posted tuesday november pm edt beginning earth without form void darkness face deep satan said doesnt get better god said let light let earth bring forth grass herb fruit tree yielding fruit god saw good satan said goes neighborhood god created man woman saw lean fit god populated earth broccoli cauliflower spinach green yellow vegetables satan said know get back game created cheeseburger man said supersize fries gained pounds satan brought forth chocolate woman gained pounds satan brought forth fried chicken fried steak big needed platter mans cholesterol went roof god sent running shoes man resolved lose weight satan brought forth remote control espn espn man gained another pounds god said youre running score devil brought forth potato vegetable naturally low fat brimming nutrition satan peeled healthful skin sliced starchy center chips deepfat fried man clutched remote ate potato chips swaddled cholesterol went cardiac arrest satan said good god sighed created quadruple bypass surgery satan created hmos obamacare aloha learn hesh listen read hundreds health related radio shows articles learn stay healthy reverse degenerative diseases use organic sulfur crystals incredible bee pollen ever please visit wwwhealthtalkhawaiicom email heshgoldsteingmailcom call since going radio products began sell work oh yeah going wwwasanedietcom allow read various parts book sane diet insane world containing wonderful comment mike adams hawaii tv stations interview local authors books write newspapers book reviews one would touch sane diet insane world goes advertising dollars might also like,1.0

you may remember ambassador samantha power from the time she proposed invading israel since then shes gone on to a glorious career of representing the castro regime at the un or is it the obama regime it naturally gets confusing when the us ambassador to the un sides with the enemy against her own country 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you 
under obama power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the united states and they say obama is some sort of antiamerican traitor i dont see it if he were we would be seeing signs of it by now 
anyway power then went on to audition for the job of the un ambassador from cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal communist dictatorship about our human rights are wellfounded 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust

WATCH: My Summer Vacation In Croatia,2016-11-03T22:22:02.579+02:00,comment on  tips for having sex with croatian girls by watch my summer vacation in croatia,"over the last decades south korea has emerged as one of the wealthiest countries in all of asia currently the oecd country is roughly on the same material and economic level as other affluent east asian nations such as japan hong kong and taiwan however it appears now as perhaps the most potentially strong among them south korea seems more dynamic and willful than its larger neighbor and economic main rival japan which perhaps has entered the path of a more longterm decline
in this article i do briefly describe the main characteristics of contemporary south korea and also reflect upon various cultural subtopics which are of importance for any male who is interested in to obtain more sophisticated knowledge about nonwestern cultures and what they might and might not offer
the emergence of modern south korea culturally politically technologically and economically south korean development during the th century onward cannot be understood without to mention the strong ties to japan and the united states as much as japan suppressed korea between  the material progression is nevertheless a direct and indirect consequence of the traumatic colonial period korean leaders were also inspired by the japanese military dictatorship which in turn was influenced by european militarism after south koreawhich was formed in  after the divide of the countrystopped relying on american aid and focused on its own potential the economy grew rapidly due to an effective exportoriented industrialization
democracy was gradually introduced in  but some of these authoritarian residues are still visible in todays society the military in particular but also with regard to how many companies are run
presently the economicpolitical relationships between south korea and japan remain flexible and pragmatic for the sake of both countries the ties to the us seems less problematic although koreans negotiate between on one hand a more distinguished korean culture and on the other further western influences
additional ambivalence might also be a result of that some koreans regard american relations as a hinder in the process of a future reunification between the two korean nations generally though the political military and economic cooperation between south korea and the us appears fruitful and to the benefit of both sides
the korean wave and the rising appeal of south korea 
for quite a long time modern south korea may be regarded as not much more than a smaller version of japan although with a unique language and some other differentiating characteristics in postmillennial times however this picture has gradually shiftedboth among other asians westerners and people in other continents tootowards a more appealing national image
the reason for this is mainly material related to a refined development of technology samsung pop music kpop tv dramas kdrama cosmetic products kbeauty and perhaps also a more exciting metropolitan nightlife and a better ranked top university seoul national university the korean wave hallyu covers a whole plethora of different expressions of the rising popularity of south korean products and celebrities and it has had spillover effects for other sectors such as academia and tourism for instance more people are interested in learning korean than  or  years ago
the nightlife in the capital seoul is unhesitatingly of very high standard for instance this year dj mag ranks club octagon in gangnam as the fifth best night club in the entire world  in the city regions gangnam hongdae and itaewon in particular both foreigners and locals can easily find bars and clubs of various sizes that offer highquality entertainment and which conform to a relatively broad spectrum of tastes in music and dress style
cultural characteristics contempory south korean culture can be described as a hybrid of korean east asian and western culture as i have stated above south korea has been influenced by japan and the us in particular to a significant extent this means that the similar real or quasihierarchical structures as in for instance china and japan are visible in south korea too one is expected to speak and behave in different ways depending on a persons age or social rank which are more or less explicitly stated
this does largely overlap a meritocratic social structure rather than status being a primarily inherited factor a doctor is looked upon as socially more valuable than a regular office worker regardless of family background it is thus not much left of the old confucian system
the korean languageeven though about  of the words are based on chinese words and its grammar being partly similar to japaneseis unique with all its different suffixes that in turn conform to different speech and writing levels these can be more or less formal plain and polite but are always related to the social relations and contexts of either speaking or writing people who know each other well tend to use an intimate speech style haeche but in some contexts such as the workplace they might change to a more formal and polite level haeyoche when they walk to other people many who learn korean at a beginners level start with haeyoche and then gradually broaden the scope to include other levels of speaking and writing
apart from the korean language a foreigner may find many things in south korea that are either similar to places such as japan and hong kong or to the western world south korea especially seoul is largely the product of globalization and as a wealthy country this goes along with high standards of infrastructure and general quality of life as a hightech nation it appears as being in the forefront of material development often outshining its western counterparts at least in some ways
the present culture especially the more youthoriented culture is safe and relaxed only slight modifications in dress and behavior towards more politeness and moderation makes any westerner fit in well at least short termwise and to only speak english is seldom a real obstacle
if a person digs deeper into korean history and cultureand geographically move outside the seoul metropolitan areaone may find many differentiating and even somewhat unique characteristics although these do often have china as its root or point of departure but apart from buddhismwhich is separated rather than integrated into the larger societythese elements are seldom manifested in present time there are obviously many real buddhists and christians in present south korea but the traditional layers of culture tend to be mere relics of the past with that said the country as a whole is overall more socially conservative than many western counterparts

whether or not the trend towards increased westernization will continue remains an open question but in terms of technology and popular culture it is unlikely that south korea will look in other directions in the near future after all much of its present infrastructure and popular culture makes it into pretty much a local version of the westernglobal society
lastly two other things that have direct implications for any foreign person who reflects upon the option to stay longer in south korea than as a tourist temporary employee or exchange student is that  the population is very homogeneous and  it has no explicit will to change this fact
this means that it is difficult although not totally impossible to obtain a citizenship if you are not of korean descent south korea uses a type of partial jas sanguinis  citizenship by the blood it is not very uncommon these days that korean men get married to and have children with for instance southeast asian women such as filipinas and south korea is gradually shifting towards a more multiethnic society however compared to many western countries the levels of ethnic and genetic heterogeneity are much much smaller
due to the legal difficulties and cultural differences especially languagewise it is definitely not a smooth process to become naturalized as a korean citizen or resident permanent and temporary living are generally two very different things and south korea is yet another palpable manifestation of that
women in south korea phenotypically south korean women are similar to those of other east asian populations as a result of drastically improved nutrition younger south koreans are relatively tall seemingly not much shorter on average than their western counterparts the levels of obesity are slightly rising but still very low compared to the us canada and even thinner european countries such as italy and sweden overall korean femalesespecially girlscan be characterized as moderately tall and slim
additionally a significant share cares a lot about their appearances fashion diet hair style and makeup are all very important in everyday life and although these things change rapidly due to new trends and seasonal shifts many will ride along the same wave wherever it goes collectivism is quite striking in that respect and subcultures are not as widespread and visible as in japan many look about the same
as with many phenomena in life the extent to which a person likes or dislikes how a population generally appears is related to individual taste with that said i think that more objectively speaking the two main strengths of korean girls and younger women are that they are relatively thin and wellgroomed they do everything they can to optimize their beauty potentials sometimes even with the help of plastic surgery which will make them look somewhat more european which partly is an ideal among east asian populations

additionallyeven if this stems more from observations and anecdotes than general factsthey tend to be more polite and welleducated in a positive sense than western females this is something they also have in common with other well off asians such as japanese taiwanese and singaporeans in the more exciting locations of seoul one will find quite many pretty and decent korean girls and even though hookup culture has for good and for bad penetrated the south of the korean peninsula a significant share of these females may be looked upon as serious girlfriend material
western guys do have a comparative advantage in terms of looks and even sometimes behavior korean guys tend to lack the cockiness of westerners but these automatic benefits should not be overemphasized many of the things that girls are attracted to such as confidence extroversion and good looks are general close to universal traits if one is a loser in the west then one will probably be that in the east as well conversely the more alpha males will magnify their results if they have the proper time and opportunity to do so
conclusion overall south korea is a rather impressive modern society that shares many of the good features with its equally rich neighbors however recently it has seemingly surpassed places like japan and hong kong in terms of material development nightlife and popular culture for some western males between the ages of  south korea might offer a valuable opportunity for temporaryranging from weeks to even years and circular migration because eventually it is most likely time to go home regardless if one wishes it or not

british prime minister theresa may is facing growing criticism over her comments about brexit at a leaked private speech to goldman sachs 
the premier who has publicly made the case for a hard brexit following a june referendum speaks of the benefits of being an eu member in the hourlong session whose audio file was leaked to the guardian on tuesday night drawing harsh criticism on wednesday 
i think the economic arguments are clear i think being part of a  million population trading bloc is significant for us i think as i was saying to you a little earlier that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the uk because it is the uk in europe she is heard saying if we were not in europe i think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say do they need to develop a mainland europe presence rather than a uk presence so i think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms 
the leader of the rival labour party jeremy corbyn attacked the prime minister for having failed to address her own concerns about leaving the european union 
corbyn has previously been calling on the toryheld government for a clear plan to exit the bloc a video grab from footage broadcast by the uk parliaments parliamentary recording unit pru shows british opposition labour party leader jeremy corbyn r as he responds during prime ministers questions pmqs in the house of commons in london on october   photo by afp 
the prime minister has given her private views on brexit to goldman sachs bankers but refuses to give the british people a clear plan for negotiations said the labour leader it shouldnt take a leaked tape for the public to find out what she really thinks 
the former labour leader and leading member of the open britain campaign group ed miliband also reacted to the comments saying the leaked comments prove that may shares the concerns of all the britons on brexit 
if private warnings are to be matched by proper public debate it is essential that the government is not allowed to hoard vital analysis of the impact on our economy of leaving the single market this work is being done in government and it must now be published he said asserting that mays comments demonstrated that the prime minister was just as worried privately as the rest of us are publicly about the economic impact of the hard destructive brexit her government seems set on 
according to the guardian  the audio file was leaked as may was prioritizing cutting immigration over staying in the single market while refusing to elaborate any further on her plans for taking the uk out of the eu british foreign minister boris johnson leaves the weekly cabinet meeting at  downing street in london on october   photo by afp 
in an unpublished newspaper column written before the june  referendum for the telegraph  uk secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs boris johnson who is another leave campaigner in the public also defended remaining an eu member

Max Roscoe,2016-10-29T00:01:03.952+03:00,how influential french author alain soral become red pilled,"the celebrations have ended and weve all come to absorb the fact that donald trump is our next president an outcome that many of us have aggressively worked for in the past several months now that weve gotten what we wanted its time to describe exactly how a trump presidency will improve our standing
if the president can say it then you can say it 
the biggest effect well see is the death of political correctness we now have a shitlord for president who has insulted ugly women as fat pigs and whose private macho talk which all masculine men have done was relentlessly attacked by the press but not punished in the voter booth this means that when you talk like trump the first thought your listener will have is he sounds like the president of the united states
what excuse will they now have for limiting your speech if one man was able to gain the highest office in the land because of it either trump was elected because voters liked a person who makes those kinds of statements or they didnt care enough that he made them whichever explanation you accept means that the will of the american people has stated that you can exercise your free speech your opinions and your desire to flirt with attractive women without having to obey a speech police force that evaluates everything you do based on how offensive it is to a kaleidoscope of races and loony identities you can begin removing your politically correct filter
im in a state of exuberance that we now have a president who rates women on a  scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude we may have to institute a new feature called would trump bang to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer and not the beauty at every size sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes  the president of the united states does not see the value in fat women who dont take care of themselves and neither should you
liberals will be forced to tolerate us in a way they didnt have to before 
there are so many of us that we can ease out of the closet and not be afraid of persecution like before what are they going to do fire everyone who supports trump accuse every man who voted for him of rape the way the establishment has been able to marginalize us is to corner men individually and apply intense pressure but now we have natural allies in all men who back trump even if they dont subscribe to our particular interpretation of masculinity 
liberals will not be able to point and shriek to get you to withdraw like before they will not have easy victories by using labels like racist or sexist they will have to endure us in their midst and bite their lip when we offend their degenerate ideals knowing that the price of attacking us is becoming too costly it may be as simple as whipping out your maga hat as if its a bat signal and having fellow trump supporters come to your aid i know that if i see a trump supporter in trouble i will help him regardless of his race or station liberals will be forced to share space with those whom they hate instead of trying to exile them like in the past
it will be easier to find a fellow traveler 
men who hold our beliefs have long ago learned that we cant go around sharing them in public to those who are not vetted if youre like me you first test a new man you meet with a masculine comment to see how he responds such as remarking on the attractiveness of a woman or how youve heard of a community online that trolls liberals without mercy weve even had to devise a special pet shop code to know if a man is aware of the teachings that are found on rok or the forum  we now have a easier shortcut in trump
if a man tells you that he voted for trump its safe to say that he is favorable to strong borders nationalism  masculinity and beautiful women on a basic level you will be able to get along with this man and build a bond it also works the other way around where you bring up trump to screen out those who are offended by him its fine if someone is politically indifferent but if a man opposes trump then i have to anticipate him attacking or sabotaging me in the future i will distance myself from him for my own wellbeing
the cultural decline will halt 
we now have a president who will not encourage antimale propaganda rape culture and female victimhood while i do have minor concerns on the influence of his feministminded daughter ivanka trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of obama because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense longterm manipulation it is more than enough for trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order stop feeding the rot and it will die off allowing biology to naturally reassert itself
weve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we havent had a chance to understand whats going on and adapt instead weve been reacting from one blow to the next whether its the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration trumps victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harms way
conclusion paradoxically the benefits of a trump presidency will not involve specific actions from trump his presence automatically legitimizes masculine behaviors that were previously labeled sexist and misogynist while we may still get heat for them it will be less severe and well be less likely to sustain serious damage liberals will have no choice but to silently stew on our words and we can more effortlessly connect with men not only for male bonding but also to push back against a demoralized and fractured left victories will be far easier to achieve under trump than obama
this is our moment the door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men and the best part of it is that we dont need to wait for trump to do anything his victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bulls horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors it would be icing on the cake if trump rolled back antimasculine laws and policies but its not required because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands return of kings opened in  and the only surprise for me is how quickly the name is being fulfilled

Kim Petersen,2016-10-30T02:00:00.000+02:00,an eight point brief for voting to avoid corporate evil,"gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads  shares  
amateur footage emerged on saturday showing what appears to be turkish soldiers executing two female pkk insurgents at pointblank range 
almasdar news that released the footage says they are not able to independently verify it 
a ceasefire between turkey and the pkk ended last year and clashes have since claimed hundreds of lives on both sides 
the pkk operates primarily in the mountanious terrain of southeastern turkey and often uploads footage of its kurdish fighters ambushing turkish government troops more erdogan vows heavy price for coup plotters 
the tension between kurdish fighters and turkish government have always been high in past years in yet one of the most recent cases a turkish court banned the coleader of turkeys prokurdish opposition from traveling abroad as part of a court case in which she has been accused of being a member of an armed terrorist group hurriyet daily reported on saturday reuters reported 
figen yuksekdag cochair of peoples democratic party hdp is facing jail time up to  years over comments she made last year in the southeastern border town of suruc the prosecutor of the case requested the ban 
hdp described the courts decision to bar yuksekdag from foreign travel as political and arbitrary saying in a statement that it will make a formal appeal for its overturn 
the move comes days after the comayors of diyarbakir the largest city in the southeast were detained as part of a security crackdown turkeys largely kurdish southeast has been rocked by violence following the collapse of a ceasefire between the state and the kurdistan workers party pkk last year 
president tayyip erdogan has accused the hdp of being a political extension of the outlawed pkk and repeatedly called for the prosecution of its members he has also said the removal of elected officials and civil servants accused of links to the pkk was a vital part of the battle against it 
several other hdp lawmakers including cochair selahattin demirtas are also being prosecuted largely over terrorism charges after the parliament earlier this year lifted the immunity of hdp deputies along with the immunity of mps from other parties 
meanwhile three turkish soldiers were killed and five others were wounded by mortar fire from pkk militants near the southeastern town of cukurca security sources said 
soldiers who were on an operation in cukurca in hakkari province bordering iraq and iraq returned the fire sources said operations were under way to hunt down the militants

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-27T04:50:26.351+03:00,project veritas ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago,"realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep john bennett ventures where few dare to tread october   robert spencer 
in an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative john bennett of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed 
on tuesday bennett held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america 
this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism 
and so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  
gaubatz and guandolo presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since imad enchassi the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas 
guandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence 
predictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against bennett rep bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep bennett as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community 
the world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates 
but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection 
john bennett and the people of oklahoma deserve better there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc bennett dared to raise them tuesday for that he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in  these concerns are more urgent than ever 
the media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated please email the speaker of the oklahoma house jeff w hickman politely and courteously expressing your support for john bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series his email is email protected and his phone number is

behind obama sits a bust of abraham lincoln his eyes downcast mourning for his country

-NO AUTHOR-,2016-10-27T00:04:50.285+03:00,young patient,"judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary unelected and unaccountable  rule on their empathetic feelings published  mins ago bob unruh about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print 
a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced 
moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family 
before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional 
the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law 
mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group 
the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary 
daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america 
how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution 
samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it 
the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority 
for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way 
they refused 
then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people 
as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned 
rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage 
at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained 
justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said 
see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol 
the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court 
wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate 
it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project  
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell",english,wnd.com,http://mobile.wnd.com/files/2015/11/Nov-2-2015-7.jpg,bias,1.0,un declares junk food human rights issue,wars rumors wars nato calls troops faceoff putin largest military buildup russias borders since cold war published mins ago haaretz nato press allies wednesday contribute biggest military buildup russias borders since cold war alliance prepares protracted quarrel moscow russias aircraft carrier heading syria show force along europes shores alliance defense ministers aim make good july promise nato leaders send forces baltic states eastern poland early next year united states hopes binding commitments europe fill four battle groups troops part natos response russias annexation crimea concern could try similar tactic europes exsoviet states,1.0

if david frum had suggested that hillary clinton used to play for the patriots i would have found his argument a little more credible than claiming that she is a patriot 
but she is a patriot she will uphold the sovereignty and independence of the united states she will defend allies she will execute the laws with reasonable impartiality she may bend some rules for her own and her supporters advantage she will not outright defy legality altogether above all she can govern herself the first indispensable qualification for governing others 
this is under an atlantic piece headlined the conservative case for hillary which also contends why support a candidate who rejects your preferences and offends your opinions dont do it for herdo it for the republic and the constitution 
the trouble with this line of argument is that hillarys own agenda includes a rejection of the first and second amendment its a rather unusual way to support the constitution by destroying it 
then theres the whole hillary is a quarterback for the new england patriots business who has ever accused hillary clinton of being a patriot how was this patriotism manifested in benghazi in iran in russia ill skip over the outright defy legality altogether argument though its certainly sad that this is now considered some sort of high water mark 
but can hillary govern herself is the compulsive liar who cant help shouting i was in new york on  really capable of governing herself 
i am voting to defend americans profoundest shared commitment a commitment to norms and rules that today protect my rights under a president i dont favor and that will tomorrow do the same service for you

the page document written in  by doug band of teneo a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed bill clinton inc the washington examiner reports 
in one instance band secured a  donation to the clinton foundation from banking giant ubs he later arranged for bill clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of  the hill reported

we appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the tax exempt status of the foundation band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism the hill reports 
band cofounded teneo with former state department employee declan kelly while hillary clinton was secretary of state  and paid bill clinton as an adviser through  the hill reports

political activist and hillary supporter amal clooney traveled to texas to warn americans about our elected president donald j trump and his tough immigration policies maybe she didnt get the memotrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of gop primary contenders it wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence there will never be a president trump 
perhaps amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of american ranchers and threatened the safety and security of american citizens living in homes in or near the us mexican border towns 
amal clooney has warned that many of presidentelect trumps proposals would be violations of international law 
speaking at the texas conference for women at the austin convention center on tuesday the international human rights lawyer and wife of george clooney said she had concerns about americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans 
she noted that trumps comments during his campaign that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the us or the fact that there should be statesponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that 
the yearold wife said americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk 
i think theres some concern from abroad as to are these things actually going to happen or is the us going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally according to the hollywood reporter 
perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us 
both amal and her hollywood actor husband george a staunch hillary clinton supporter have spoken out against trump in the past 
earlier this year amal clooney called for trump to be challenged on his extreme views 
watch george clooney here whine about press giving trump too much favorable press 
when you listen to what the leading candidate on the republican side has been saying about building walls about excluding mexicans and a complete shutdown of all muslims entering in and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about muslims he kept saying they only want jihad they dont believe in our way of life they dont respect our system clooney said via daily mail",english,100percentfedup.com,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2553918-thumb.jpg,bias,1.0,wow white liberals suggest blacks stupid get idscant figure use internet video,go article political activist hillary supporter amal clooney traveled texas warn americans elected president donald j trump tough immigration policies maybe didnt get memotrumps tough immigration stance catapulted top heap crowded pack gop primary contenders wasnt long ago arrogant liberal husband announced great confidence never president trump perhaps amal shouldve traveled border towns wanted get clear picture illegal immigration affecting nation aliens crossing borders illegally destroyed property american ranchers threatened safety security american citizens living homes near us mexican border towns amal clooney warned many presidentelect trumps proposals would violations international law speaking texas conference women austin convention center tuesday international human rights lawyer wife george clooney said concerns americas reputation real estate moguls plans noted trumps comments campaign religious test imposed entering us fact statesponsored torture families suspected terrorists killed things violations international human rights law values underlie yearold wife said americas reputation country strong human rights record high moral standing risk think theres concern abroad things actually going happen us going lose moral standing internationally according hollywood reporter perhaps time put nations security sovereignty worry people countries around world think us amal hollywood actor husband george staunch hillary clinton supporter spoken trump past earlier year amal clooney called trump challenged extreme views watch george clooney whine press giving trump much favorable press listen leading candidate republican side saying building walls excluding mexicans complete shutdown muslims entering actually look specifically said infamous speech muslims kept saying want jihad dont believe way life dont respect system clooney said via daily mail,1.0

usa usa usa they chanted together in the hilton ballroom as the results came in who needs polls they never gave him a chance but now we have it president donald trump not only were the polls spectacularly wrong who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what america was thinking across its societal spectrum what it wanted what was felt deep in its blood
it is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire west has wallowed in since the s and a rejection of obama and the false hope he decried the impotent nature of us political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by crooked hillary
the world must live with it democracy has spoken and theyre going to have to get over the words president trump some will head for the hills some will run to canada others will continue to cry but as obama said yesterday regardless of the result tomorrow the sun will still shine
this is a cry for american exceptionalism and like him or not trump typifies that he is committed to education and demands high performance selling well is an admirable skill for a president to have negotiating with congress internationally etc is exceptionally useful trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose
trumps business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates  this gives him keen realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships andor antagonism between different industries and particular governments
more trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trump turkey and police tyranny the crisis of imperialism finds political expression an america in denial this vote comes down to the reckoning that for too long politicians have sold the american people out to foreign nations and global industry what donald trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying nevertrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate
although it is entirely true that trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes he brings something to the presidential table no other candidate had before he speaks his mind
america clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear they want the facts straight
president trump isnt cut from the political class that class which is entrenched in its selfinterest and has let the country down time and time again ross perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables a corrupted ethically questionable president is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and im not talking about donald trump
trump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos he is not a social engineer a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts the liberal democratic policies of obama us rep nancy pelosi us sen harry reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today
so what if his language is intemperate and insulting even lacking in nobility from time to time how can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long
obama won because conservative voters stayed home he had promise and he let so many down what did clinton have and that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote
trump prefers isolationism on a world scale clinton voted to take us to war in iraq and to overthrow libyas gaddafi all in the guise of being muscular
perhaps todays landmark and historic decision is not so much about trumps strengths and power but more about the crippled weakness of the country in  and you simply cannot blame him for that",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/School_Privatization_b90fa.jpg,bs,0.0,title,shares usa usa usa chanted together hilton ballroom results came needs polls never gave chance president donald trump polls spectacularly wrong ever trust particularly bankrupt form moralising presumptive analysis telling us feel also pundits arrogant fact trump chance also hopelessly touch america thinking across societal spectrum wanted felt deep blood rejection liberal consensus entire west wallowed since rejection obama false hope decried impotent nature us political leverage around world rejection brazen corruption questionable ethics typified crooked hillary world must live democracy spoken theyre going get words president trump head hills run canada others continue cry obama said yesterday regardless result tomorrow sun still shine cry american exceptionalism like trump typifies committed education demands high performance selling well admirable skill president negotiating congress internationally etc exceptionally useful trump taken beatings financially come smelling like rose trumps business experience involves negotiations business leaders even governments around world likely connections behind scenes surpass simply purely political candidates gives keen realistic insights economics different parts world well additional avenues pursue trade agreements even perhaps nuanced insights particular financial weaknesses possible global competitors mention experience insight partnerships andor antagonism different industries particular governments trumps sexual predator characteristics grandfather pimp least paid women hired significance gops attempted purge donald trump trump turkey police tyranny crisis imperialism finds political expression america denial vote comes reckoning long politicians sold american people foreign nations global industry donald trump representing absolute heartbreak anger frustration government gone mad seems left completely underestimated vitriol crying nevertrump portraying devil incarnate although entirely true trump ostentatious mistakes brings something presidential table candidate speaks mind america clearly sick weasel politicians afraid say people want hear want facts straight president trump isnt cut political class class entrenched selfinterest let country time time ross perot said need somebody clean stables corrupted ethically questionable president therefore answer order accomplish im talking donald trump trump pragmatist era rapidly approaching chaos social engineer think tanker wants please lining bank accounts liberal democratic policies obama us rep nancy pelosi us sen harry reid company created climate led decision today language intemperate insulting even lacking nobility time time true changemaker straitjacketed politically correct chains must express people uncomfortable concerns lie dormant far long obama conservative voters stayed home promise let many clinton conservative voters get vote trump prefers isolationism world scale clinton voted take us war iraq overthrow libyas gaddafi guise muscular perhaps todays landmark historic decision much trumps strengths power crippled weakness country simply cannot blame,1.0

buffalo ny  in their relentless and often violent pursuit to control what citizens can and cannot put in their bodies the state leaves behind a trail of blood and suffering as the buffalo police department illustrated last week this trail often contains the blood of defenseless animals 
police incompetence coupled with deadly training came to a head last week and wreaked havoc on the residents of buffalo the narcotics division of the buffalo police department executed a series of drug raids last week leading to a handful of arrests and the seizure of small quantities of drugs  mostly cannabis 
after the department released their heroic numbers to the press on how much dangerous cannabis was taken off the streets they remained conveniently silent about the dogs they slaughtered along the way 
on friday morning buffalo cops in their search for a  lb  black male raided the home of michael urban  a   lb white male 
while police were ramming the innocent mans face into his kitchen floor urban pleaded with them not to kill his dog but it was to no avail 
police took aim at the helpless dog who according to urban was simply standing there in a nonthreatening manner boom one officer fired but the bullet only injured urbans monthold pit bull named gotham sending him running away frightened and crying 
as the dog is wailing in agony another officer fires a round directly into the dogs skull exploding the innocent animals head but it gets worse 
urban lives on the second floor of an apartment when the second officer shot that bullet went through the floor and almost killed the tenant downstairs 
what just happened urban recalls as the bullet hole went through the floor through the ceiling as the dogs blood is dripping through the downstairs apartment whos accountable 
as gothams blood drips from the bullet hole in urbans floor and out of the hole of jami krafchaks ceiling in the apartment below cops decided to go after her too 
after they nearly killed her cops raided krafchaks home she was manhandled searched with no warrant and humiliated as she stood there in her nightgown 
neither urban nor krafchak were charged with a crime 
the night before the heroic cops of the buffalo narcotics division killed an innocent mans beloved pet they raided the home of cory and cindy meer 
according to meers lawyer matthew albert  meer and his twoyearold son watched helplessly as jackboots murdered their beloved family dog damian a sixyearold pit bull 
meer tells artvoice that his dog was not a threat to officers he is the most family friendly dog ive ever had hes never hurt anyone said meer he would have licked the cops 
just like urban meer lied face down as he begged the cops not to shoot damian again this was to no avail 
as meers yearold watched in horror a cop blasted the family dog to death 
my son lost his best friend right in front of him meer said 
also like urban meer was not arrested however a friend at his house allegedly had a small amount of marijuana on him so the raid was justified according to police 
according to meers attorney he has  active cases of dogs being killed by the same squad 
they are going to say they are going after dangerous drug dealers albert said out of the cases i have theyve hit the wrong houses numerous times  found nothing numerous times and i think at best theyve found a few pills at one of these houses charges i got dismissed because they were filed wrong 
in  the free thought project reported on a freedom of information act request for use of force incidents within the buffalo police department the information was shocking 
according to use of force reports buffalo police shot  dogs from jan   through sept  seventythree of those dogs died nineteen survived 
to provide a comparison buffalos numbers more than triple the amount of dog shooting incidents involving police in cincinnati a municipality of similar size 
the numbers are what the numbers are buffalo police chief of detectives dennis richards said in an interview with wgrz in  certainly no officer takes any satisfaction in having to dispatch a dog 
apparently however they do it is not like buffalo residents have more dogs than other parts of the country this department seemingly takes satisfaction in killing peoples dogs 
when asked if the buffalo police have undergone any special training in regards to dealing with dogs or the handling of dogs in a nonlethal manner chief richards said it has not come to that point in buffalo that weve implemented any of those other techniques 
apparently killing a dog every other week or two in a hour period is just dandy and they see no problem with it or reason to seek out training to deal with such a high rate of puppycide 
something has to be done however and it is far more than just training the most effective action that would need to be taken would be to drastically reduce the instance of noknock search warrants according to an aclu report  percent of swat raids are searches for drugs 
if we want to end puppycide we have to end the drug war  the two are not mutually exclusive matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist share google  cousinscootie 
adam arroyo still waiting for justice from a  killing of his dog on a wrong address raid wtf are the judges in buffalo doing handing out noknock search warrants for refer with the track record of buffalo narcotics 
noknock search warrants this is the real crime 
the words search warrant cant even apply in these cases its more like an execution warrant 
the only acceptable cause to conduct a raid especially on a civilian residence is if there is a hostage situation 
no hostage no raid common sense 
so a bunch of steroid junkies have to miss out on playing war games with civilian lives well too bad we can call that an acceptable loss mike 
i hope and pray that everyone of these thug cops that shot dogs get shot themselves and left to bleed out in the gutter like the trash they truly are gordon klock 
they clearly get some nonadmitted sense of satisfaction by killing peoples pets in front of them  we all are coming to know that there is absolutely no reasoning with these sadistic clowns the war on drugs has always been a scam to generate prison labor  terrorize the populace whilst maintaining the naive illusion that it is all somehow morally responsible behavior to harm  incarcerate people over such an exaggerated threat more likely to oneself if at all  they really seem to enjoy scaring the helpless as they commit these acts of brutality that wouldve been illegal for them to do three or four decades ago katz ro

Henry Wolff,2016-11-05T00:24:00.000+02:00,putin condemns europes handling of migrants and says the child rape in austria shows a dilution of national values,"posted on november   how hillary courts the black vote ethnomasochism reaches a new low 
the democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the nonwhite vote as the guardian summed up one of the debates hillary clinton and bernie sanders made a conspicuous play for latino and african american voters mrs clinton won the conspicuous play hands down and with it the nomination the failure of senator sanders to win the necessary quotient of nonwhite votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out 
in february one black commenter pointedly wrote that sen sanders has many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests by may black commenter steven thrasher wrote a piece titled  bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes  and its his own fault  mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem as failing to talk about racism at every turn 
this accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered his stage to black lives matter activists several times but in comparison to mrs clinton mr thrasher was right about sen sanders no mainstream candidate in the history of the united states has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than mrs clinton since this helped her win the democratic nomination she has continued the strategy in the few days remaining before november th lets take a look at hillary clintons most ethnomasochistic moments 
 in january of  mrs clinton was at something called the iowa brown and black forum with none other than jorge ramos  where she was asked can you tell us what the term white privilege means to you and can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it this is how she began her answer 
where do i start i think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when youre standing on the shore perhaps watching     i was born white middleclass in the middle of america    
 early in the democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of bernie sanders 
whereas the electorates in iowa and new hampshire are largely ruralsuburban and predominantly white the march primary states better reflect the true diversity of the democratic party and the nation     it will be very difficult if not impossible for a democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among african american and hispanic voters we believe thats how it should be emphasis added 
 shortly before the south carolina primary at schomburg center for research in black culture in harlem mrs clinton explained how to break down barriers for african americans 
ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of usespecially those of us who havent experienced it ourselves white americans need to do a better job of listening when african americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day 
we need to recognize our privilege and practice humility rather than assume that our experiences are everyones experiences all of us need to bring our skills to bearand especially young people coming up today who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems 
 in april of  while on a back radio show mrs clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag she immediately answered hot sauce when one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer she asked hopeully is it working 
 just a few weeks after a black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers  the democratic national convention that convened to nominate mrs clinton passed a resolution no doubt with her approval supporting black lives matter  
the dnc joins with americans across the country in affirming black lives matter and the say her name efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed african american men women and children 
white politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades but this election has set a new low and if mrs clinton loses her pandering could live on in another form as the black lives matter activist tef poe explained  if mr trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go    aint no more rules weve been too nice as is",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,0.0,putin condemns europes handling migrants says child rape austria shows dilution national values,posted november hillary courts black vote ethnomasochism reaches new low democratic presidential primary one unprecedented pandering nonwhite vote guardian summed one debates hillary clinton bernie sanders made conspicuous play latino african american voters mrs clinton conspicuous play hands nomination failure senator sanders win necessary quotient nonwhite votes repeatedly pointed chattering class time dropped february one black commenter pointedly wrote sen sanders many miles go convince black voters fight interests may black commenter steven thrasher wrote piece titled bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes fault mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem failing talk racism every turn accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered stage black lives matter activists several times comparison mrs clinton mr thrasher right sen sanders mainstream candidate history united states thoroughly debased quest black vote mrs clinton since helped win democratic nomination continued strategy days remaining november th lets take look hillary clintons ethnomasochistic moments january mrs clinton something called iowa brown black forum none jorge ramos asked tell us term white privilege means give example life career think benefitted began answer start think hard swimming ocean know exactly happening around much youre standing shore perhaps watching born white middleclass middle america early democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released memo aimed stifling rising momentum bernie sanders whereas electorates iowa new hampshire largely ruralsuburban predominantly white march primary states better reflect true diversity democratic party nation difficult impossible democrat win nomination without strong levels support among african american hispanic voters believe thats emphasis added shortly south carolina primary schomburg center research black culture harlem mrs clinton explained break barriers african americans ending systemic racism requires contributions usespecially us havent experienced white americans need better job listening african americans talk seen unseen barriers face every day need recognize privilege practice humility rather assume experiences everyones experiences us need bring skills bearand especially young people coming today passion social justice helping create new ways solve intractable problems april back radio show mrs clinton asked always carries bag immediately answered hot sauce one black hosts noted would accused pandering black people giving answer asked hopeully working weeks black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers democratic national convention convened nominate mrs clinton passed resolution doubt approval supporting black lives matter dnc joins americans across country affirming black lives matter say name efforts make visible pain fellow sister americans condemn extrajudicial killings unarmed african american men women children white politicians tried win elections public displays ethnomasochism decades election set new low mrs clinton loses pandering could live another form black lives matter activist tef poe explained mr trump wins young niggas fully hell bent inciting riots everywhere go aint rules weve nice,1.0

illegal aliens are flooding through the border at an unprecedented pace according to border patrol agents the surge is taking place because human smugglers are issuing warning that its now or never to get into the us 
if trump wins the illegal aliens are told there will be a giant wall keeping them out of the us permanently if clinton wins they are led to believe amnesty will be granted both incentives are driving the illegal entries to a level not seen in years and according to agents in texas the border patrol is overwhelmed with  apprehensions per night in just one sector 
according to the department of homeland security in fiscal  the border patrol apprehended  immigrants from central america almost onethird of all apprehensions borderwide  and  more than during the socalled surge of  the agency also apprehended  haitians up from just  last year the number of immigrants claiming to be from africa and asia also is up 

when you stop somebody you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is  im here for asylum i cant go home because theyll kill me  when it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them they have a rehearsed story said chris cabrera a representative from the border patrol council told fox news once they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint well never see them again

The Alex Jones Show,2016-10-28T21:12:27.535+03:00,trump votes are being flipped to clinton,"big pharma targets profits in rare diseases all of the worlds most expensive drugs are used to treat uncommon conditions image credits stocksnappixabay  
one might think big pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more wellknown diseases but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next big thing in rare diseases 
big pharmas profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments 
the search for the next moneymaker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments which may explain why they still havent discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the worlds population 
in  the orphan drug act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs werent as profitable 
because of the incentives which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees over  new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced 
for common illnesses big pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug for example liptior atorvastatin which is used to regulate cholesterol generates a sales profit of  billion with the prescription only costing patients around  per day 
but with rare diseases prices must be kept high in order to keep big pharma in business this means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures their pocketbooks are in for a hit 
for example the cystic fibrosis drug kalydeco by vertex costs individual patients  
gileads sovaldi used to treat hepatitis c cashes in at  for a paltry week course of medication 
and soliris used to treat rare blood conditions costs the patient a whopping  per year 
the list of the  most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat orphan or uncommon illnesses 
thanks to these laws that allow big pharma to charge these insane amounts of money they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-30T06:57:17.661+02:00,obamas doj hasnt approved warrant for fbi of new hillary emails,"dems file complaint wdoj against fbi for investigating hillary   
its an obviously absurd move but considering that the doj has become a transparently political organization that abuses and attacks law enforcement on a regular basis including in the eric garner case the fbi this is just how things work in the hall of mirrors that the left has made  
the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
its silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismissexcept that bizarre and unlikely tactics no longer are there was outrage over moveons attack on petraeus and even most dems thought that it was unhelpful this attack on comey i suspect will meet with little criticism some dems will consider it a helpful preemptive move even though with his track record comey is as likely to hurt hillary as he is himself",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/huma_1.jpg?itok=1ndvuau-,hate,1.0,obamas attorney general warned fbi director inform congress new hillary investigation,media spin fbis actions deeply troubling hillarys hillary email investigation reopened due sexting investigation close aides husband media focused outrage disgust gruesome weinerabedinhillary trio fbi reporting line alternate universe left inhabits media brimming headlines attacking fbi investigating hillary hillary clinton called fbis actions deeply troubling instead media made propagandistic decision upend scandal coverage portraying fbis actions investigating hillary scandal rather hillarys actions agenda blatantly obvious also telling left decided real scandal investigating,1.0
Matthew Vadum,2016-11-01T07:32:54.394+02:00,democratic panic,"dawn perlmutter 
the war on law enforcement is epidemic every aspect of culture has been infected the antipolice disease is highly contagious and rapidly spreading on social media in memes in movements in popular fast food restaurants at football games on campuses in media and in every aspect of american culture 
an epidemic is defined as the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time colin kaepernick is the typhoid mary of the antipolice epidemic kaepernick refuses to stand while the us national anthem is being performed at the start of nfl games as a protest against alleged racial injustice and police brutality on sept  kaepernick chose to kneel on one knee as his protest gesture instead of just sitting on the bench his explanation for his decision to switch is that it was an attempt to show more respect to former and current us military members as if kneeling is somehow symbolically less offensive than sitting he misinterpreted the meaning of the military expression take a knee which occurs when troops take a pause before continuing their mission similar to hands up dont shoot the antipolice gesture has been imbued with a trendy righteousness regardless of its original meaning the media reverently refers to kaepernicks protest as taking a knee as if it is some kind of sacred act there are no headlines that read kaepernick disses the flag or kaepernick takes a crap on his country just in case his gesture didnt send a clear enough message kaepernick also uses clothing to symbolize his antipolice sympathies he has worn everything from tshirts honoring the militant black panther party to socks that depict police as pigs in addition to numerous other crimes the black panther party was responsible for the murder of at least  officers and originated the expression off the pigs meaning murder police 
like the typhoid infected cook mary mallon kaepernick is rapidly spreading the antipolice pathogen in what has been dubbed the kaepernick effect dozens of nfl and wnba players have knelt sat or raised a fist during the national anthem the disease has also spread to over  high schools  colleges and one middle school in what can only be described as a bizarre symbolic contradiction there were two incidents where women performing the star spangled banner got down on one knee in protest of what they were singing one of the women denasia lawrence not only kneeled while performing the anthem but also opened her jacket to display a black lives matter tshirt exposing miami heat fans to the contagious disorder 
rapid spread is well known for infectious diseases the antipolice disorder also contaminated the navy an unidentified sailor assigned to the naval air technical training center in pensacola florida filmed herself deliberately not standing for the national anthem and posted it on facebook she remained seated and raised a fist during morning colors and then praised colin kaepernick another sailor petty officer nd class janaye ervin an intelligence specialist in the navy reserve stationed at pearl harbor did not stand for the national anthem while in uniform she also posted a statement on facebook saying she was inspired by colin kaepernick the navy acted decisively she lost her security clearance and may be facing jail in response to her actions it is yet to be known if facing real consequences will contribute to curing the virus or accelerating it 
kaepernick is just one carrier of the antipolice disease the source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as black lives matter that originated in florida during the trayvon martin protests the disease went airborne in ferguson missouri where it was transmitted to college students professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda the symptoms are irrationality excessive anger impaired perception anxiety hatred and delusions of oppression acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior aggression paranoia loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies all indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order 
early symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers antipolice graffiti is a common symptom of the virus writing has escalated from insults such as police are murderers to threats of violence a recent popular indicator is the expression kill cops and related variations such as kill all police save a life kill a cop cops lives dont matter and shoot cops threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers heads violent antipolice rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read all my heroes kill cops put wings on pigs kill cops and cops under control or cops under flowers disturbingly antipolice graffiti protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified 
the antipolice epidemic has also spread to wellknown fast food restaurants employees have refused to serve officers at a taco bell in phenix city al dunkin donuts in west hartford ct krispy kreme in columbia sc ihop in virginia beach va arbys in pembroke pines fl chuck e cheese in bowling green ky whataburger in lewisville tx mcdonalds in brenham tx chipotle in brooklyn ny genghis grill in dallas tx noodles  company in alexandria va tropical smoothie in winter haven fl luckys teriyaki sedrowoolley wa and at the krystal restaurant in irondale al other incidents involved employees refusing to let an officer use the restroom in a philadelphia starbucks refusing service at a sunoco gas station in miramar fl writing black lives matter on an officers coffee cup at a dunkin donuts in providence ri and a walmart bakery in mcdonough ga refusing to bake a cake for a police officers retirement party these are just the incidents that have been made public 
refusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect law enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with for this reason many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made this is a legitimate concern on aug   in louisville ky five police officers were denied service at a taco bell when another employee took their orders they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying im going to mess with them which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant when officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a fullscale epidemic 
the antipolice infection went viral on social media facebook twitter instagram and other social networks have hundreds of antipolice pages ridiculing disrespecting and threatening officers protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers the following are examples of popular hashtags ftp fuck the police bluelivesmurder acab all cops are bastards bluelivesdontmatter fuckcops fuckthemall apdk all police dept killer fryemlikebacon blacklivesmatter ferguson milwaukeeuprising and kaepernick 
as the disease progresses more acute symptoms begin to manifest in acts of violence a particularly offensive indicator of the disorder is the desecration of fallen officer memorials memorials honoring officers killed in the line of duty have been attacked in philadelphia chicago albuquerque fresno denver new orleans oakland austin honolulu rochester san diego st paul covington richmond goshen fayetteville raleigh and many other cities across the country vandalism has involved everything from dousing in paint toppling and scratching granite burning to destroying a metal torch in order to extinguish the eternal flame in a previous article  i described these acts as symbolic assassinations vandals target tributes to heroic officers because they want to appropriate the valor honor and respect that they think they have been deprived of this is another symptom of the antipolice disease a sense of entitlement and resentment that leads to both symbolic and actual attacks on law enforcement officers 
at its most critical stage the antipolice disorder is lethal this is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers in the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident a pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence consequently kaepernicks gesture is neither benign nor harmless it is one symptom in a deadly epidemic",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/tr3.jpg?itok=OFI7QhAc,hate,1.0,obama wont vote america un,government truly alleviate poverty leftist policies made worse november thomas sowell political left keeps announcing new breakthrough discovery life unfair never read thomas grays elegy written country churchyard two half centuries ago economic historian david landes statement world never level playing field joint autobiography milton friedman wife rose say everywhere world gross inequities income wealth offend us fail moved contrast luxury enjoyed grinding poverty suffered others moreover professor friedman left behind foundation dedicated promoting school choice disadvantaged children could get better education better chance life political left saying think new breakthrough necessity progress important test evidence ever subjected notions one presented social vision left often nicholas kristof new york times one certain happen share vision dont get repeatedly declared mr kristofs essay growing poor america october th new york times classic example mindset left begins story poor black teenager arkansas raised single mom sometimes goes hungry home even one book television sets huge screens apparently money enough buy marijuana surely agree young fellow unpromising future prospects ahead human tragedy circumstances life unfair none us would want born circumstances moreover one many brought setting full dangers low probability improvement enough mr kristof political left general youngsters says society fail long fail us whoa society make decisions engage actions led teenager bad situation society acquire either omniscience omnipotence prevent left says society usually mean government apparently society means case kristof laments teenager kind person americas presidential candidates dont talk left chooses believe government intervention answer tragedies right expect rest us share belief surely could subject belief empirical test however triumphant decade wanted government intervention solve called social problems work things like social vision triumphed things like afterwards homicide victimization rates among black males going substantially homicide victimization rates reversed skyrocketed wiping progress two previous decades began black children born families mother father great welfare state expansion black children born single mother like youngster arkansas today kristofs essay also mentions teenage girl single mother suggests sex education could prevented getting pregnant teenage pregnancy going repeat reversed shot began bringing sex education vision schools across country similar trends occurred england similar visions policies also triumphed perhaps left doesnt get cannot face hard fact vision policies worsened things claimed would made better,1.0
Letsbereal,2016-10-26T17:14:00.000+03:00,no title,"home this month popular  tips for having sex with croatian girls  tips for having sex with croatian girls february    comments travel day game 
 croatian girls are extremely receptive to day game they want to be opened even if she has headphones and seems focused on her music it can still go well same goes for girls on rollerblades excuse me where can i buy rollerblades like yours 
 croatia is one of those places where both indirect and direct game work pick one that suits the venue and your personality what i did was open indirect chat for a couple minutes and then hit her with a compliment about her positive energy to see how shed respond if she smiled i knew i was in 
 girls will give you their number even if they have a boyfriend it may not come out until the first meeting to avoid this when i was getting a number id jokingly say youre not married right if she had a boyfriend she would then announce it with a guilty look on her face 
 always go for the instadate especially if youre doing street game not only will this weed out flakey girls but it gives you an opportunity to find out what she wants in life croatia has a lot of good girls who dont drink at all and want a serious relationship you want to dump those prospects if youre not staying long 
 a common issue youll find on the first date is girls who want to bring their friends along dont let them or youll get stuck in a hellish group chat its either a on date or nothing night game 
 you need to push the interaction as far as you can go if you dont at least get a kiss the odds that number will lead to a date is  or less if you get a passionate kiss with some handholding at the end over  its easy to get a number from a croatian girl but you should resist push for the kiss its similar to what you should do in america 
 absolutely do not add a croatian girl to facebook they are accomplished attention whores and will string you along if you didnt at least get a phone number you got nothing 
 cockblocking is a huge problem the best way to fight it is to be more selective about the venues you choose large clubs have the hottest girls but they are harder to approach and you will end up getting cockblocked incessantly hipster bars have the ugliest girls but youll rarely get cockblocked experiment in the city to find something in the middle that has the best balance between beauty and attitude so much of a successful croatian experience will be based on the venue going from the best venue to the worst you may even feel like youre in a different country as a general rule if youre in a club where the girls arent genuinely excited youre a foreigner you should go somewhere else 
 since so many girls go out in pairs its better to roll with a wingman than solo dolo a problem youll face if you re going out solo is that a girl doesnt want to leave her friend alone what i did was approach girls whose friend was already getting hit on by another guy 
 dont compliment at night  croatian girls already have an elevated perception of themselves and get compliments all the time they are not insecure as girls from the baltics or ukraine  
 dont call a girl before you bang her they rarely answer text instead 
 croatia is slowly embracing onenight stands with the right logistics you should be able to get them they are far easier than a place like ukraine the key here is having tight logistics it should be so tight that you can take a walk with her and be at your place to hop in for a quick drink the girls who are most likely to go for this will be  and who want a taste of the american sexual culture older women will be able to resist your logistical game 
 similar to the above point all your dates should be close to your apartment if your date venue is more than half a mile away youre already shooting yourself in the foot even if a croatian girl is playing aloof she can turn on a dime once in a private room 
 the less snobby the club the more acceptable it is to buy a girl a drink without getting punished for it croatia isnt like other eastern european countries where girls are generally upfront and honest with their intentionsthey will play you if you give them the opportunity especially the higher end venues generally speaking as long as she didnt have a bitch face when you first approached her you should be in the clear to buy a drink  
 the best game for zagreb the capital is to have the best logistics possible sadly croatian girls flake more than average so you want the proximity of your apartment to act as bait for casual hangouts that turn into bangs unless youre dealing with an older croatian girl who is into you youll have to play the numbers game and not get hung up on any one girl get ready to meet some hardcore female players 
 if you put x hours a day into day game and x hours into night game youll be rewarded with night game first you can get surprisingly fast bangs at night that day game doesnt provide mostly because aggressive night game easily screens out day girls who are simply bored but not really hankering for dick if i go back to croatia ill just move right next to a good bar",english,prisonplanet.com,No

Sasha Brown,2016-10-27T23:08:00.000+03:00,why marijuana should be legalized across the globe,"keywords complimentary medicine  holistic health  homeopathy  nhs 
the department for health is currently reviewing whether or not homeopathy in the nhs should continue to be available through doctor referrals against a backdrop of funding cuts and increasing pressure to reduce costs the government and health managers are looking at whether to add homeopathy to the nhss schedule  blacklist a selection of products that nhs doctors are banned from prescribing 
however despite consistent claims that there is a lack of quality evidence into the positive health benefits of homeopathy the nhs has spent more than m on homeopathic treatments over the last  years and any proposed ban is likely to have its fair share of detractors 
almost six million brits seek the help complementary and alternative medicine of which homeopathy is a part with one in four wanting access to be universally available through the nhs 
the lead argument for the exclusion of homeopathic treatment is lack of evidence that supports its effectiveness with research often being labeled as inconclusive however proponents for the inclusion of homeopathy argue that this doesnt necessarily mean that there is no evidence 
dr helen beaumont a gp and the president of the faculty of homeopathy has recently stated that homeopathic treatment has a profound effect on patients 
its disappointing that at a time when the nhs is facing a funding crisis the department of health is embarking on a costly consultation that could prevent highly skilled clinicians prescribing a course of treatment that benefits thousands of patients each year if the department were serious about saving money surely it should be looking at ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prescribed for mild to moderate depression in vast quantities at considerable cost to the nhs but which studies have found to be ineffective for those conditions 
george freeman the minister for life sciences has stated that in a time of rising demand the government has a duty to ensure nhs funds are spent only on the most effective treatments however an article in the british medical journal bmj that examined the scientific evidence behind nhs treatments found that  of  commonly used nhs treatments are of unknown effectiveness and only  are known to be beneficial the argument is being made that the principals being applied to homeopathy are consistent for all forms of treatments throughout the nhs 
collating research itself has also proved to be difficult with the positive effects of homeopathy often a challenge to fully quantify the nhs is driven by targets and trial evidence using hard data like death and disease to determine the effectiveness of a particular treatment researching and recording a patients quality of life happiness and emotional satisfaction has always been much more difficult to quantify but a wealth of anecdotal evidence and studies from other european countries continue to support the use of homeopathic treatment 
for example in  over a hundred homeopathic gp practices in germany and switzerland took up the challenge  of demonstrating the health of chronically ill patients after eight years of homeopathic treatment it concluded that homeopathy is clinically effective costeffective and safe  with the results playing an important role in the inclusion of homeopathy as part of their national healthcare scheme 
similarly the largest study at bristol homeopathic hospital  followed the effectiveness of homeopathy on  consecutive patients over a sixyear period  of followup patients reported improved health with  reporting major improvement 
the debate whether homeopathy in the nhs will no doubt continue the homeopathic profession has had to face increasing criticism and hostility over recent years but with an average annual spend of  on homeopathic treatment the equivalent of  of the total nhs drug budget it should be remembered that if these patients were not treated with homeopathic medicines they would have to be treated by other nhs departments with potentially more expensive conventional drugs   bmc public health bmc series    doi

Jason Easley,2016-10-30T18:24:32.083+02:00,early voting is so strong for democrats that clinton could lock up nevada this week,"politics us senator bernie sanders 
former us democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders has threatened presidentelect donald trump warning that his camp will be trumps worst nightmare if he goes after minorities in america 
if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims hispanics african americans and women we will be his worst nightmare the vermont senator wrote on his twitter page on thursday 
the yearold senator had earlier issued a statement after the new york businessmans victory in the us election on november  promising to work with him on certain issues but also to oppose him should he pursue divisive and discriminatory policies 
to the degree that mr trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country i and other progressives are prepared to work with him sanders said 
to the degree that he pursues racist sexist xenophobic and antienvironment policies we will vigorously oppose him he added 
during the primaries sanders ran a close race with clinton and promised to continue the fight all the way until the democratic national convention in june where the partys nominee was going to be named 
towards the end of the race however sanders changed his tone and bowed out in favor of clinton he also appeared next to her during the dnc and supported his party opponent in the democratic campaigns 
on july   sanders formally endorsed clinton after facing mounting pressure from major democratic figures including outgoing us president barack obama himself us republican presidentelect donald trump delivers his acceptance speech during his election night event at the new york hilton midtown in the early morning hours of november   in new york city photo by afp 
on tuesday trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored clinton in the presidential election sending the united states on a new uncertain path 
trump rode a wave of anger toward the elite us establishment to win the white house race against clinton a longtime washington insider 
the new york businessman garnered  electoral votes in the  us election while his rival and the former secretary of state received  votes despite winning the popular vote 
thousands of people since then have rallied in cities across the us to protest against trumps presidential election victory condemning his controversial campaign rhetoric against muslims immigrants women and other groups 
this is while trump said in his victory speech he would be president for all americans it is time for us to come together as one united people he said 
the real estate moguls election campaign had been marred by his disparaging remarks against minorities in the us his comments include a call to ban all muslims from coming to america as well as stopping mexican migrants by building a long wall along the usmexico border 
he has also sought for a database to track muslims across the united states and said that the us would have absolutely no choice but to close down mosques 
trumps proposal was widely condemned by muslim and human rights groups as well as his democratic rivals and many of his republican proponents who describe the proposal as divisive counterproductive and contrary to american values loading",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/clinton-trump-fact-check.jpg,bias,1.0,email pandemonium perpetuation rape culture,politics fbi director james comey afp file photo hillary clintons top advisers blame fbi director james comey democrats bruising loss presidentelect donald trump navin nayak head clinton campaigns opinion research division sent email senior staffers thursday outlining early signals candidate lost november presidential election politico reported friday believe lost election last week said nayaks email published politico comeys letter last days election helped depress turnout also drove away critical support among collegeeducated white voters particularly suburbs also think comeys nd letter intended absolve sec clinton actually helped bolster trumps turnout continued letter also highlighted several challenges clinton team faced throughout campaign including desire change two terms democratic president reluctance americans vote female candidate hillary clinton makes concession speech defeated donald trump new york november photo afp despite challenges nayak said clinton course win last week everything changed momentum began shift favor trump voters decided last week broke trump larger margin numbers even exaggerated key battleground states said fbi director angered democrats late october announcing letter congress agency uncovered new emails connected clinton email investigation week later comey notified congress clinton would face charges newly discovered messages nayak said comeys letters encouraged trump supporters depressed turnout clinton election day question week election day sec clinton poised historic win end less k votes tens millions cast election day made difference race wrote end nayak concluded late breaking developments race proved one hurdle many us overcome clinton leading trump throughout campaign polls except last week election lost ground trump,1.0

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-01T13:09:43.088+02:00,head of hillary transition project israel is depressing,"fbi releases files on bill clintons cash for pardons scandal november   daniel greenfield 
the fbi has an early present for hillary clinton its the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash that fugitive was a fellow by the name of marc rich his prosecutor james comey 
the fbi unexpectedly released  pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in  into president bill clintons pardon of marc rich who had been married to a wealthy democratic donor 
the unusual timing of the release was the result of a freedom of information act request that had been completed and was posted under standard fbi practice according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters but the clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release 
well of course it did its never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you 
the investigation stemmed from one of several pardons clinton made on the last day of his presidency in  that of financier and international fugitive marc rich whose exwife denise had given to the democratic national committee and the entity that would later become the clinton foundation 
and theres a surprise guest 
while the files may seem dated they invoke figures beyond the clintons who went on to play key roles in official washington  including comey 
he served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against rich from  to  as the us attorney in manhattan in  comey took over a criminal investigation of clintons pardons i was stunned at the rich pardon comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in

syria has dismissed as baseless recent allegations brought against the damascus government by western countries in connection with chemical attacks in the wartorn arab country 
the syrian arab republic has repeatedly denied all allegations circulated by some western circles and their agents about the use of chemical poisonous materials by syrian sides like chlorine gas during military operations against terrorists syrias foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the official sana news agency on wednesday 
the statement came four days after an international inquiry blamed syrian government forces for a toxic gas attack in qminas in northwestern idlib province on march   
the accusation was made in the fourth report from the monthlong probe by the united nations and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons 
however the syrian foreign ministry statement said that there was no tangible evidence for the inquirys findings 
syria has repeatedly warned against repercussions of politicizing this issue regarding the credibility of the work of international relevant sides the ministry added 
it also stressed that the syrian government remains committed to all its obligations under the chemical weapons convention a multilateral treaty that bans chemical weapons and requires their destruction 
daesh has frequently used chemical weapons in both in syria and iraq where the takfiri terrorist group is mainly active 
a report by the syrianamerican medical society published back in march said that daesh had carried out more than  attacks involving poisonous or asphyxiating agents such as sarin chlorine and mustard gas since the beginning of the conflict in syria the report added that over  people had been killed in the chemical attacks

sunday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags herculex  yield guard  crop failures naturalnews the utter failure of geneticallymodified crops gmos is once again on full display this time with crop products made by companies other than the usual monsanto  a novel variety of transgenic corn produced and marketed by both dow chemical corporation and dupont is not exactly working as claimed new reports indicate and agricultural experts are urging the chemical industry to immediately cease selling these failed products to farmersknown as herculex the synthetic corn in question contains a gene modification thats supposed to prevent a pest known as the western bean cutworm from destroying crops but so far the genetic alteration has done nothing to stop this worm which means farmers everywhere have been paying through their teeth for a technology that not only doesnt work  but thats also proprietary and exceptionally costly especially when compared to nongmo and organic crops that are opensource and are not patented or owned by multinational corporationsa group of six entomologists published an open letter to the seed industry in a recent issue of purdue universitys pest  crop newsletter  calling on those involved to do the right thing and fess up to the fact that herculex doesnt work farmers will soon be gearing up to plant next years crops and they need to know that its best to look elsewhere for corn thats not going to result in massive yield reductionspeople are frustrated and angry and more importantly yield was lost the letter states before growers make seed choices for  we again urge the seed industry to acknowledge the reality of what is happening in the field dupont quietly admits herculex doesnt work but refuses to take responsibility in typical corporate fashion the owners of herculex are refusing to take the letter seriously resorting instead to excuses and legal speak to try to explain away the gm crops failure rather than pull the herculex product from the market dupont according to bloomberg  has instead decided to merely decreased its efficiency rating in the companys  product use guide from very good to moderatedupont has also issued an accompanying statement urging farmers to add other inputs to try to control cutworms including spraying additional chemical insecticides in other words herculex doesnt actually work and duponts solution is to have farmers just go ahead and blast away with all those endocrinedisrupting cancercausing chemicals to kill anything and everything that might be living on or around the crop its basically the same advice that monsanto is giving to farmers who foolishly adopted a similar gm corn product known as yieldgard that was supposed to deter the western corn root worm the insecticidal proteins in this crop product just like the one in herculex  known as cryf  havent lived up to all the wild marketing claims and yet both monsanto and duponts products continue to be sold to farmerscryf has failed in our states the letter continues adding that the scientists involved have already received dozens of calls and emails about the problem from concerned farmers for growers in our states the costs of scouting and spraying cryf corn negates a major reason they purchased and planted a hybrid with the trait in the first placeif left to run their course western bean cutworms and western corn root rooms will effectively eat up all the corn kernels and leave the plant defenseless encouraging the growth of harmful fungi and mycotoxins and since none of what the chemical industry has proposed as a solution is working their only recommended option is to spray more glyphosate dicamba d and other chemicals on their products sources for this article

sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease when it comes to dietary claims made by the sugar industry we need to take them with a grain of salt 
researchers at the university of california san francisco have uncovered documents and communications dating back as far as the s revealing that the srf sugar research foundation now known as the sugar association funded research to serve its own interest to create a sweet image of sugar 
at the time heart disease was on the rise as was the consumption of dietary fat and sugar instead of trying to determine the true cause for the higher occurrence of the disease the biased research focused everyones attention on fat 
ucsfs finding published in jama internal medicine shows researchers at leading universities including harvard were paid by the srf in an effort to portray dietary fat as the major cause of heart disease in the process sugars role in the fatal disease has been ignored singing the praises of lowfat foods 
as a result of the biased research published in many esteemed publications life in the second half of the th century was filled with misleading dietary recommendations and scary headlines 
warnings regarding the dangers of dietary fat ran rampant eating fat especially the saturated variety was equivalent to clogging your arteries even eating an egg containing  grams of the forbidden macronutrient was considered a luxury not to be indulged in more than once per week 
lowfat diets became the craze in fact lowfat labels decorated food packaging throughout groceries stores from yoghurt aisles to frozen sections consumers felt good whenever they chose lowfat varieties over standard options 
yet this sense of wellbeing generated by the lowfat fad was unfounded to add flavour to lowfat foods sugar was the usual substitute and the truth that has been uncovered is that sugar is a secret killer it contributes not only to obesity and diabetes but also to the leading cause of death worldwide cardiovascular disease cvd a time for change 
recently the sugar industrys funded research has been challenged by unbiased studies which reveal sugar to possess the unwelcome property previously and falsely attributed to fat it leads to atherosclerosis 
jama internal medicine has published a study by a team of ucsf researchers showing that sugar aside from causing diabetes and tooth decay sets into motion several changes that bring on heart disease in this study the diets of  children were changed to replace added sugar with starch while maintaining the same amounts of protein fat complex carbohydrates and total caloric intake the results showed beneficial effects on ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure 
another study undertaken by researchers from saint lukes mid america heart institute and albert einstein college of medicine and published in progress in cardiovascular diseases showed that consuming diets high in added sugar caused an increase in ldl bad cholesterol total cholesterol and triglycerides while lowering hdl good cholesterol 
the new research results have brought about a change in worldwide dietary guidelines from governmental associations to medical organisations and private practitioners are warning consumers and patients about sugars toxicity 
the us dietary guidelines for  to  recommend that added sugars make up less than  percent of a persons daily calorie consumption while the main reason for this recommendation is that added sugar constitutes empty calories and leads to a nutrientdeficient diet the guidelines also acknowledge that there is strong evidencelower intake of sources of added sugars are associated with reduced risk of cvd in adults 
the american heart association warns that too much added sugar in your diet could significantly increase your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease it recommends lowering dietary sugar intake even further to a maximum of  teaspoons and  teaspoons for women and men respectively how can something sweet be so bad 
according to one cardiologist dr stephen sinatra sugar delivers its damage to the cardiovascular system via a surge in insulin high levels of insulin wreak havoc on blood vessels endothelial linings an inflammatory response ensues causing the walls of the blood vessels to become clogged in this way the stage is set for heart disease 
add to that the wellknown fact that sugar leads to diabetes which raises the risk of heart disease and the overall danger is compounded addictive properties exacerbate the problem 
it seems that the sugar industry pushed us toward a secret killer just like the tobacco industry did this notion seems even more valid in light of medical claims that sugar like nicotine is an addictive substance 
in medical circles addiction is an altered state of the brain which causes repetitive behaviour despite negative consequences experts state that studies on rats prove sugar to be more addictive than cocaine 
when our bodies digest sugar they release dopamine and opioids these neurotransmitters play a key role in the brains reward centre which in turn causes addiction to the same substance that set off too much activity in this pleasure circuit so what do we do now 
we need to gather public funding to carry out unbiased research on consumer goods including foods 
food labels should allow consumers to identify easily how much added sugar is present in every food item 
every processed food item should not be allowed to contain more than  percent of its total calories from added sugars 
widespread education regarding sugars toxicity should reach from the classroom to our doctors offices 
everyone deserves the chance to break the cycle of sugar addiction

no wonder bill went elsewhere to fulfill his sexual addiction as dolly referred to it after all what else can you do when youre married to a stinky woman who doesnt shower and isnt attracted to men anyways although an affair is never justified its easy to sympathize with bill on this one but i digress 
the bigger point here is what the two are willing to do in order to remain in power most people know that you cant trust hillary as far as you can throw her  which isnt very far  so the fact that she has any supporters is beyond baffling at this point this woman is corrupt and fake to the core lets just hope all of america wakes up to this reality before its too late and she can do any more damage than she already has 
bill and hillary clinton just cant stay out of the spotlight these days and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet as it turns out someone once close to the duo just came forward to share bills revealing nickname for his wife  but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed 
its no mystery that bill clinton is a sexual deviant but the most recent account given by the woman who had a decade affair with the man is damning to say the least according to an exclusive interview given to mail online dolly kyle was behind the scenes long enough to not only know the twos darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits  and now shes telling everyone 
the connection between dolly and bill began when she was just yearsold he was about yearsold at the time but dolly states that there was an immediate attraction even then as the years progressed the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next  years 
the real affair began in  just after dolly divorced her first husband and although bill wasnt married yet he would be within the year although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship she states that she snapped when she heard hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the right to be believed 
knowing full well just what hillary had done  between the threats and the lies  to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband bill dolly knew she had to do something about it unfortunately for hillary dolly is now coming forward with the dirty word nickname bill husband once called hillary among other things 
according to mail online bill approached dolly at their high schools year reunion to talk about  the warden  aka hillary saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage this was the least significant account dolly had to share 
in fact dolly recalls that bill mentioned something about having a baby to her although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her he was actually talking about hillary he wanted to put to bed the rumors that hillary was a lesbian even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true 
dolly states that the worst came when she met hillary for the first time in that moment i noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering body odor of perspiration and greasy hair i hoped that i wouldnt gag when she got in my car she said the sandalshod woman with lank smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone

EdJenner,2016-11-03T07:22:47.669+02:00,obama doj handmaiden of clinton corruption,"fbi wiretapped corruption suspect discussing clinton deals november   daniel greenfield 
if youre wondering why team hillary panicked and unleashed hell on the fbi this may be another ingredient in the stew the wall street journal article is clearly trying to spin things to the left and damage the credibility of the fbi but its an interesting data point  
the fbi had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the clintons made these people said the agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate but it was they thought worth checking out 
prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics like presenting evidence to a grand jury because the person who was secretly recorded wasnt inside the clinton foundation 
fbi investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case 
as prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those justice department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly 
in short fbi people had material for a case that the government didnt want brought because team obama were hillary backers and the senior leadership in the doj saw their careers linked to the rise of hillary and so a stand down order was handed down

Infowars.com,2016-10-26T21:54:55.089+03:00,top clinton ally caught accepting k foreign donation,"store us government acknowledges that alqaeda is not a priority in syria one might ask then if alqaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror what is darius shahtahmasebi  anti media  october   comments 
last week the us state department acknowledged that alqaedalinked terror group jabhat alnusra is not a priority for the united states efforts in syria 
one might ask then if alqaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror what is 
state department spokesman john kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma stating 
the only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in syria is bashar alassad and his supporters  we recognize alnusra as a spoiler we have concerns about comingling ive talked about this ad nauseam 
largely missing from the american narrative of the syrian conflict is that alnusra is shelling residential areas in aleppo where the government holds control of the majority of aleppos citizens in other parts of the world these alqaedalinked extremists are seen as the enemy whereas in syria western media will often refer to them as mere rebel groups 
the united states first officially used the term war on terror on september   to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of september  the stated aim at the time was to defeat islamiclinked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the us government accused of supporting terrorism 
in  obama stated  
 we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror but rather as a series of persistent targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten america 
the fact that a terror group  one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the united states on american soil  is not a priority of the united states state department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is

Frontpagemag.com,2016-10-31T11:11:00.000+02:00,freedom center urges college presidents to end aid to campus supporters of terror,"search selective outrage over splcs antimuslim extremist list leftists and atheists appalled that splcs hit list of islam critics includesleftists and atheists october   robert spencer 
sam harris thinks its unbelievable that maajid nawaz and ayaan hirsi ali made it to the southern poverty law centers hit list of antimuslim extremists he said nothing about me or the other people whom the splc included which is not surprising since he has quite recently expressed willingness to acquiesce in other contexts to the demonization that the splc list exemplifies 
hemant mehta of the friendly atheist blog ably sums up the outrage over nawaz and hirsi ali being included if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before other vocal atheists end up on that list too and make no mistake thats what nawaz and hirsi ali are doing thats all theyre doing theyre not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
the problem with being angry about nawaz and hirsi ali being on the splc list but silent about everyone else who is on it is that what mehta says about nawaz and hirsi ali can quite accurately said about everyone else on the list if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before everyone who dares to utter a critical word about islam will be on the list  and that is indeed the objective of the list to stigmatize and marginalize any and all such critics mehta protests that nawaz and hirsi ali are not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
but no one would think that the other  were antimuslim if it hadnt been for the southern poverty law center and the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair and their allied groups insisting that we were all these years in their avidity to conflate opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression with hating a group of people  a tactic designed to discredit opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression mehta and co are falling for and validating the same smear tactics hey are decrying when used against their friends 
and as for working with moderate muslims for  years jihad watch has contained this invitation  any muslim who renounces violent jihad and dhimmitude is welcome to join in our antijihadist efforts it is nawaz as well as other moderates who has attacked me in what appears to have been a cynical attempt to gain support for himself among muslims i never attacked him and would have have been happy to work with him otherwise 
in complaining that nawaz and hirsi ali are merely criticizing religious beliefs and are not antimuslim mehta is strongly implying that the others on the splc list are doing something beyond criticizing religious beliefs and are indeed antimuslim on twitter the last couple of days ive seen many people express outrage that nawaz has been lumped in with the likes of spencer but when i ask them what the big difference is between us or for quotes from me that are actually bigoted they go silent 
mehta harris haider and the others who are only angry with the splcs hit list because it included nawaz and hirsi ali are by their selective outrage acquiescing to and legitimizing the splcs demonization of the other people on the list in his own defense hemant mehta wrote me to explain somewhat unsatisfactorily i focused on those two because theyre well known in atheist circles this is a selfdefeating choice for them to have made for the splc has never identified anyone whom it considers to be a legitimate critic of islam and never will the point of lists such as the one they released yesterday is to demonize and silence everyone who dares say something about islam that is not warmly positive 
the turn of mehta harris and haider will come for the same treatment one wonders if when this happens there will be anyone left to speak for them who has not already been smeared as antimuslim with their tacit approval",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sdf.jpg?itok=a_1pk7_P,hate,1.0,hillary clinton presidents longer game,hillary panicking fbi weiner emails past days seen major shift clinton tactics original investigation clinton campaign political media allies launched attacks republicans wasting time investigating hillary attack fbi misrepresented fbi statements certainly target investigators way seeing open hostilities lynch doj fbi clinton campaign circulating letter attacking fbi countless media hit pieces aimed fbi obvious question clinton campaign kept cool least degree certainly didnt begin illadvised campaign fbi thats kind tactic may play core base alienates everyone else say everyone isnt media whats going clintons thought done close election theyre lashing typically paranoid nasty behavior clintons hillary tried playing humble tried apologizing moment ago victory seemed inevitable shes state fury put risk something emails genuinely frightens clinton campaign took crazy risk going fbi barrels desperate smear fbi much possible order neutralize revelations even potential charges attacks warning treat hillary kid gloves else first plausible degree hillarys awkwardness didnt lose past losing theres evidence beyond speculation latter yet major shift tactics rather striking clinton campaign panicking would look like,1.0

cremtine is one of your bodys um most important neuro chemicals that regulates uh several good benefits for being healthy according to leading research when you go running or do other similar cardiovascular exercises one positive reward that happens is that your brain ramps up its cremtine which of course leads to er positive results  take a power nap 
you hear that sound that is the sound of your body saying thanks for the cremtine which is what it does after you take a power nap the sleep synthesizes the cremtine which in turn activates your molecules in your reward system  eat dark chocolate 
well ladies can you even believe what is happening right now yes this is your dream come to life chocolate gives you cremtine due to its ingredients promoting the production of good cremtine which unlike the diseasecausing bad cremtine is actually what is known as good cremtineyes believe it so please go ahead and eat all of it we wont tell if you wont tell just say its for your cremtine number   antioxidants 
of course as the leading scientist has reported antioxidants are among the primary building blocks for er nutrients and when you have them your cremtine production soars and soars and soars and soars and then some  eat an avocado 
avocados are extremely rich in toids and oils that according to many scientists from research university are highly effective at stimulating the cremitary gland and this as you know as data tells us is where cremtine happens moral of the story moderate consumption of an avocado is the oneway ticket to cremtine town  drink red wine 
as it has frequently been observed throughout scientists cremtine deficiencies are frequently er linked to not having enough cremtine according to the latest study yet did you also know that one of the most potent providers of vitaminladen cremtine is none other than red wine but wait you may have screamed doctors have forbidden red wine but this research has learned is now false because high red wine consumption in moderation has uh been linked to high cremtine levels in your tissues  dont drink red wine 
oof well this one of course is a nobrainer red wine as infinite researchers are telling us is uh one of the leading benefactors of alcohol which guess what that means it means that in high concentrations of red wine it has uh been widely proven to be toxic and illegal which in even the smallest cups will destroy yes that is right cremtine  so next time when it is wine o clock maybe just stick to barqs root beer trust us your cremtine will thank you later  meditate 
perhaps you have heard that meditation is rich in good benefits but did you also know that it is also rich in cremtine say no more because once you meditate for even two hours you will find that researchers have long associated this with the same compounds that give us cremtine sounds like a winwinwin  load up on gormiumb 
is your blood thick from a lack of cremtine well dont just stand there swallow a big dose of gormiumb which uh according to authorities is a tremendous tremendous source of vital cremtine all it takes is one quaff of this great nature supplement and your blood will become so uh wet and hot with cremtine that you will be able to smell it as the leading cremtine experts say gormiumb is key to cremtine this is the secret doctors dont want you to know about",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3460/9/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,0.0,life love enamel pins youll love etsy shop dont care enamel pins youll explode picture bulldog puppy doesnt youll lose shit amazinglooking pizza dont well find something,jumpstart day nine easy steps naturally increase uh cremtine brain follow nine easy steps cremtine never easier go running cremtine one bodys um important neuro chemicals regulates uh several good benefits healthy according leading research go running similar cardiovascular exercises one positive reward happens brain ramps cremtine course leads er positive results take power nap hear sound sound body saying thanks cremtine take power nap sleep synthesizes cremtine turn activates molecules reward system eat dark chocolate well ladies even believe happening right yes dream come life chocolate gives cremtine due ingredients promoting production good cremtine unlike diseasecausing bad cremtine actually known good cremtineyes believe please go ahead eat wont tell wont tell say cremtine number antioxidants course leading scientist reported antioxidants among primary building blocks er nutrients cremtine production soars soars soars soars eat avocado avocados extremely rich toids oils according many scientists research university highly effective stimulating cremitary gland know data tells us cremtine happens moral story moderate consumption avocado oneway ticket cremtine town drink red wine frequently observed throughout scientists cremtine deficiencies frequently er linked enough cremtine according latest study yet also know one potent providers vitaminladen cremtine none red wine wait may screamed doctors forbidden red wine research learned false high red wine consumption moderation uh linked high cremtine levels tissues dont drink red wine oof well one course nobrainer red wine infinite researchers telling us uh one leading benefactors alcohol guess means means high concentrations red wine uh widely proven toxic illegal even smallest cups destroy yes right cremtine next time wine clock maybe stick barqs root beer trust us cremtine thank later meditate perhaps heard meditation rich good benefits also know also rich cremtine say meditate even two hours find researchers long associated compounds give us cremtine sounds like winwinwin load gormiumb blood thick lack cremtine well dont stand swallow big dose gormiumb uh according authorities tremendous tremendous source vital cremtine takes one quaff great nature supplement blood become uh wet hot cremtine able smell leading cremtine experts say gormiumb key cremtine secret doctors dont want know,1.0

some of these laser tag facilities are continuing to operate roller rinks hole mini golf courses and gokart tracks in a shameless ploy to lure voters as far as possible from the booths said holst its an utterly transparent tactic and the saddest thing is just how effective it can be laser tag arenas represent a grave immediate threat to the democratic process

i have looked to our northern neighbour as one admires a wiser older sibling canadians to me seem less radical less extreme and more ethical than my own more reactive countrymen and women canada after all accepted our draft dodgers of the s who questioned the morality and justness of the vietnam war to me that was something to be lauded imagine my chagrin upon learning that a university professor with a year career who encourages critical analysis and social responsibility had been suspended without pay apparently without a formal and unprejudiced investigation occurring first
halls suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two american academics steven salaita and norman finkelstein both were openly critical of zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous arab populations of the occupied territories both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of palestinian rights and lost their jobs
i adjure the not to take a page out of the american playbook by punishing academics who dare to speak up for the marginalized peoples of the world please live up to the values of the wiser more ethical and socially conscientious northern neighbour you have always represented for americans like myself

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank  via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states  thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january   another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true  snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on   the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushes plan on getting out of the country as well

Claire Bernish,2016-10-27T13:22:12.612+03:00,brother of clintons campaign chair is an active foreign agent on the saudi arabian payroll,"posted on october   by isaac davis 
the months long dakota access keystone xl pipleine protest at the standing rock indian reservation by native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs  tear gas tazers  and even live ammunition  killing horses  while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up 
but as the saying goes water is life  and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for 
the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project 
so who is kelcy warren 
a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in  with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about  miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners 
forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at  billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons  but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead  source  
shockingly in  the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  million pipeline project  
according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans  source  
this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here  
most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a  mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the  mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete  mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region 
with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a  year term as  of the  commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the  in campaign contributions abbott received from warren 
footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device  lrad  crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th  final thoughts 
warren is listed as number  on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion in september of  he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake 
if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors  including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis

EdJenner,2016-11-14T15:18:26.396+02:00,watch traffic reporters savage message to those who threatened to leave us if trump won," thoughts on steve bannon as white house chief strategist by ben shapiro november   
so in a notunexpected move donald trump has elevated former breitbart news ceo steve bannon to chief strategist of the white house 
when i left breitbart back in march i accused bannon of turning breitbart news into trump pravda  as i wrote indeed breitbart news under the chairmanship of steve bannon has put a stake through the heart of andrews legacy in my opinion steve bannon is a bully and has sold out andrews mission in order to back another bully donald trump he has shaped the company into trumps personal pravda to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter 
that decision paid off for bannon  in august he became trumps campaign ceo at that point i wrote this piece describing who bannon was  and this one for the washington post describing his probable impact on the campaign  
with bannons accession to a top white house role its time to answer some brief questions about the man and what hes likely to do 
is bannon antisemitic and racist i have no evidence that bannons a racist or that hes an antisemite the huffington posts blaring headline white nationalist in the white house is overstated at the very least with that said as i wrote at the washington post in august bannon has openly embraced the racist and antisemitic altright  he called his breitbart  the platform of the altright  milo yiannopoulos the star writer at the site is an altright popularizer  even as he continuously declares with a wink that hes not a member the lefts opposition to trump and their attempts to declare all trump support the altright have obfuscated what the movement is the movement isnt all trump supporters its not conservatives unsatisfied with paul ryan nor is it people angry at the media bannon knows that hes a smart man not an ignorant one the altright in a nutshell believes that western culture is inseparable from european ethnicity  i have no evidence bannon believes that personally but hes happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into european farright nationalist populism that means that the altright will cheer bannon along as he marbles trumps speeches with talk of globalism  and that bannon wont be pushing trump to dump the racists and antisemites who support trump anytime soon after all they love bannon  actual white supremacists like peter brimelow called his august appointment great news and richard spencer explained breitbart has elective affinities with the alt right and the alt right has clearly influenced breitbart in this way breitbart has acted as a gateway to alt right ideas and writers i dont think it has done this deliberately again its a matter of elective affinities that doesnt mean bannon will push racist or antisemitic policy or that hell be antiisrael himself  unless it serves his interests 
what does bannons accession mean bannon has goals one of those goals is maximization of personal power which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful rightwing personalities bachmann morris palin kissing their asses and then moving on up the chain with breitbart and trump he picked two winners in a row  and that means hes now at the pinnacle of american power 
so what will he do with that power hell target enemies bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics which is why ive been joking for months that should trump win id be expecting my irs audit any moment that wasnt completely a joke he likes to destroy people 
but more importantly bannons interested in turning the republican party into a farright european party because republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that it could happen heres what i wrote in march about the trump movement  
trump is a europeanstyle response to the europeanstyle leftism of barack obama hes a soft europeanstyle populist from his interventionist economics to his closedborders foreign policy as i wrote in december compare trumps platform with that of marine le pen whose french national front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment she calls for harsher penalties for criminals significant restrictions on muslim immigration to france protectionism on trade a restoration of the franc as the national currency rather than the euro and big government in terms of health care this sounds a lot like trump but the european right is not the american right the american right believes in constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government the european right doesnt believe any of these things should trump win we could watch american conservatism lose the only party it has ever had 
thats the plan yesterday the daily beast reported that bannon reached out to le pen for global ultraright coalition over the weekend le pen met with nigel farage of the uk independent party and trump met with farage shortly after being elected bannon has always wanted to burn down the gop thats still his goal he wants it replaced with an american national front party in fact if not in name 
which war will bannon lead bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore  always at war always so the only question left is this what will bannons actual role be its difficult to tell since trump announced the bannon hire at the same time he announced that former rnc chairman reince priebus as his chief of staff what will their relationship be like ed morrissey of hotair thinks that bannon will lead the antimedia fight and reince will coordinate with congress that would be the best possible scenario 
others have speculated that bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base which would be angry at trump hopping into bed with the most establishmenty fellow in washington that too would be fine 
its hard to tell from the outside whats happening but heres a third theory reince is the bagman for trump and bannons whispering in trumps ear that would fit the fact pattern here given reinces outsized praise for bannon this morning wise and smartvery very smart very temperate bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree hes a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees hes actually malevolent priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because hes the one catering to bannons agenda 
if bannons leading and reince is following that bodes ill for the republican agenda bannon opposes the republican party hates paul ryan  minutes after the joint bannonpriebus announcement breitbart

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-04T01:47:41.238+02:00,david frum hillary is a patriot who will protect the constitution,"european media jihad against geert wilders as they lose their grip the political and media elites are getting desperate november   robert spencer 
the mainstream media in western europe and north america isnt even pretending to be an objective news source anymore instead journalists are working openly to quell what looks increasingly on both sides of the atlantic like a popular revolution against the hegemony of the selfappointed political and media aristocracy that seems hellbent on driving western civilization over the cliff and so its time for another round of their twominutes hate against dutch politician and freedom fighter geert wilders 
wilders has yet again gone on trial in the netherlands for hate speech and this time the case against him is especially flimsy as europe is roiled by the criminal activity of muslim migrants he is being accused of hate speech for saying that the massive influx of immigrants from morocco from which most of the muslim migrants in the netherlands come has to be stopped 
this trial could very easily backfire on the dutch inquisitors and make wilders more popular than ever with the people of the netherlands and europe in general as they are increasingly fed up with the political and media elites forcing them to accept a massive influx of muslim migrants that ensures a future only of civil strife bloodshed and sharia oppression 
consequently those elites are trying desperately to shore up their position wilders chanted no more moroccans at a rally the horror to any sane person this means stop the influx of moroccan immigrants who only inflate crime rates and welfare rolls to the media which at this point is quite insane insofar as insanity means an inability or refusal to accept reality this means genocide 
and so in this deutsche welle dw piece by freelance journalist teri schultz were told that european parliament lawmaker cecile kyenge who was born in congo had numerous racial slurs  not to mention bananas literally  thrown at her along with suggestions she go back to her country does this have anything to do with the crime and civil strife that are the foundations for wilders position of course not but wilders schultz tells us is of course farright that allpurpose and meaningless semaphore that serves only to signal to rightthinking deutsche welle readers that wilders is as far as the media elites are concerned unsavory and must be opposed and shunned his positions left unexamined 
schultz contacted me to serve as the villain of her piece being sure to tell her hapless readers that i am known for extreme antiislam views to make sure that if any of them are foolish enough to find themselves agreeing with me they will immediately reverse themselves and get their minds right the term extreme also since the western governing class unanimously refers to jihad terrorists as extremists also implies that i am a terrorist 
after the article came out i challenged schultz on this she replied i dont think even you would consider your views mainstream do you i responded absolutely yes my views were the broad mainstream in the western world from  ad until the s what changed not islamic teaching to that she said okay youd have to argue it with another expert which i am not but thanks again for contributing indeed she is just a mouthpiece for the views the political and media elites want us to hold 
in any case schultzs article merely reveals the desperation of the ruling class and the selfappointed opinionshapers they can call those of us who wish to defend the people and culture of europe and north america farright and extreme every day and they do but the public can see with their eyes what is happening wilders popularity isnt growing because he is a charming fellow which is of course not to say that he isnt its growing because he speaks the truths that the political and media elites are in a frenzy to obscure 
and its only going to get worse for them the brexit vote and the trump candidacy whether he wins or loses shows that their hegemony is beginning to be challenged those challenges will continue and grow they will before too long be decisively voted out and repudiated",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hellary_2.png?itok=-ccP3jWx,hate,1.0,smell hillarys fear,president hillary clinton share stubborn desire avoid scrutiny november lloyd billingsley president united states powerful man world working three shifts designated successor former first lady secretary state hillary clinton fbi continues investigations clinton emails continue emerge worth recalling mysteries presidents narrative last year obamas narrator new york times called david axelrod released massive believer forty years politics author recalls perfectly timed unexpected call would change life david barack said voice phone im thinking want next wondering could talk call took place explains perfect timing february presidents maternal grandfather stanley dunham passed away gramps narrator called longer around offer insights family history correct accounts might appear write one dreams father gramps might say kenyan foreign student looks lot like nat king cole actually gramps might kenyan student barack h obama bears little resemblance cole passed away enjoyed revival daughter natalies unforgettable album narrator dreams father invokes stubborn desire protect scrutiny doesnt fault people suspicions fail take face value elusive father prop someone elses narrative image could alter whim ignore convenient narrative myth tale useful fiction dreams father photo section index key characters get first name include frank gets words back president identified person frank marshall davis stalinist paul kengor regards presidents mentor explained communist untold story frank marshall davis dreams real father documentarian joel gilbert made case davis presidents biological father malik obama son kenyan barack h obama sees strong physical resemblance also holds true policy side professor kengor found remarkable similarities writings davis policies president barack obama kenyan barack obama though man left prosoviet communist prosoviet would attended patrice lumumba university moscow indeed obama warned fellow kenyans soviet meddling africa kenyan obama would found strange presidents cancelation missile defense european allies outspoken man would supported kind hightech harassment sharyl attkisson described stonewalled fight truth forces obstruction intimidation harassment obamas washington kenyan barack h obama issues strongman types jomo kenyatta ruled kenya death keeping country africa kenyan barack obama record supporter homosexual causes frank marshall davis hand certainly board davis wrote memoir livin blues dramatic civil rights demonstrations often thought ought form united front joint sitins cafes mind envisioned result indignant white restaurant manager frantically phoning police get hurry got niggers counters washrooms loaded fairies lesbians perhaps might joint march washington waving banners blacks homos arise davis pornographic novel sex rebel black might explain presidents stubborn desire protect scrutiny could also something narrator calls less flattering aspects fathers character dreams father kenyan raised muslim audacity hope confirmed atheist thinking religion much superstition like mumbojumbo witch doctors witnessed kenyan villages youth audacity narrator explains went predominantly muslim school indonesia indicate whether atheists lutherans jews buddhists also attended school registration records supposedly destroyed flooding predominantly muslim school also emerges believer axelrod indicate students faiths attended frank ann dunham stanley dunham even kenyan barack obama missing account proves enlightening ways brian williams msnbc asked presidential candidates steps would take event simultaneous terror attack major american cities axelrod explains obama neglected include would pursue perpetrators hillary clinton likewise passing privately regarded terrorist attack us compound benghazi spontaneous protest video like president clinton always shown stubborn desire protect scrutiny bleachbit hammers lies hillary handlers best make emails disappear contents remain something mystery mysteries linger president background hand things perfectly clear potus former flotus decline identify islamic terrorism shrinkwrapped statist superstition lie greatest ease counts like critters orwells animal farm one find impossible say back july party faithful chanting four years presidents speech democratic national convention,1.0

gilt ab sofort helmpflicht berlin dpo  achtung freizeitsportler ab  januar gilt in deutschlands fitnessstudios helmpflicht wer sich durch spinning in form bringen will darf das indoorbike ohne professionellen kopfschutz nicht mehr besteigen durch die neuregelung soll die unfall und verletzungsgefahr deutlich reduziert werden die helmpflicht sei ein wichtiger baustein um die sicherheit in den studios weiter zu erhöhen so der verband deutscher fitness und gesundheitsunternehmen in einer mitteilung zwar sei die gefahr von einem entgegenkommenden pkw erfasst zu werden vergleichsweise gering doch seien schon mehrere sportler vor erschöpfung vom ergometer gefallen oder von einem unaufmerksamen bodybuilder angerempelt oder gar umgestoßen worden zudem erhöhe ein helm das sicherheitsgefühl gerade bei rasanten spinningeinheiten oder berg und talfahrtsimulationen indoorbikes haben keinerlei knautschzone weshalb der kopf besonders geschützt werden muss ebenfalls aus sicherheitsgründen ist es künftig nicht mehr gestattet während der fahrt über kopfhörer musik zu hören oder auf einen bildschirm zu starren wir bauen alle monitore ab so verena hardenberg betreiberin eines privaten fitnessstudios in würzburg es hat sich herausgestellt dass die fahrer dadurch sehr stark abgelenkt werden das risiko ist uns einfach zu groß und in der branche sind bereits weitere maßnahmen im gespräch sollte die helminitiative zu kurz greifen möglicherweise müssen beim spinning demnächst neonfarbene warnwesten übergestreift oder leuchtende katzenaugen mitgeführt werden diese könne man ohnehin ganz bequem am shirt oder stirnband befestigen so sei auch in der dämmerung und in den abendstunden ein sicheres training möglich aber nicht jeder ist begeistert ich fahr doch nicht

Bob Smith,2016-11-17T05:59:43.675+02:00,hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts,"why we are still in the danger zone until january th    th  
donald trump is not the president yet and barack obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the white house prior to the election i described the period of time ending on january th as the danger zone and my outlook has not changed just because donald trump was victorious on election night as you will see the next two months are an absolutely critical time and if we can get through january th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier at least for a while on the other hand the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos a lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of trumps victory but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard 
and the truth is that donald trump has not even won the presidency yet as i detailed shortly before election night  the next president will not be determined until december th when the electoral college meets 
on monday december th the members of the electoral college will gather in all  state capitals to cast their votes for president it is then and only then that the next president of the united states will be elected 
throughout our history electors have followed the will of the people more than  perfect of the time but there have been faithless electors before and if democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in december it is still possible though not probable that hillary clinton could win the election 
one petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than  million people the petition claims that donald trump is unfit to serve as president and that since hillary clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead the following comes from a usa today article entitled  could the electoral college elect hillary clinton instead of donald trump  
a changeorg petition now signed by more than  million people encourages members of the electoral college to cast their votes for hillary clinton when the college meets on dec  the petition argues that donald trump is unfit to serve and that secretary clinton won the popular vote and should be president 
if they all vote the way their states voted donald trump will win the petition states however they can vote for hillary clinton if they choose even in states where that is not allowed their vote would still be counted they would simply pay a small fine  which we can be sure clinton supporters will be glad to pay we are calling on the electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for secretary clinton 
personally i dont believe that this is going to happen they may be able to flip a few electors but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the democrats to overcome 
however that is not the only concern we are facing ever since his victory on november th there have been a multitude of violent threats against donald trump and his family and without a doubt there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep donald trump from getting to inauguration day so let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family 
if donald trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the electoral college vote on december th mike pence would take his place 
but if something were to happen to him before december th his electors would be free to vote for another candidate  including hillary clinton 
if everything goes smoothly and donald trump successfully makes it to inauguration day he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in united states history 
in an article for the most important news  i showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon washington dc on january th in order to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as possible 
this giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects and they have already put up facebook pages  websites  and the hashtag disruptj is being widely used all over social media 
traditionally inauguration day is a day of joy and celebration but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot 
let us hope that they are not successful 
another reason why we will be in the danger zone over the next two months is because of what barack obama may choose to do at the united nations 
now that it looks like donald trump is going to be our next president the international pressure on barack obama to do something at the united nations regarding the israelipalestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense 
and this is something that trump and his advisers are actively concerned about in fact i came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the trump team is warning obama against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office  
saying that pushing agendas contrary to the presidentelects position would not be in the spirit of the transition trump national security advisor for donald trump last week warned the obama administration against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office 
on big transformative issues where president obama and presidentelect trump are not in alignment i dont think its in keeping with the spirit of the transitionto try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the presidentelects positions the advisor told politico  
specifically the concern is that obama may decide to support a un security council resolution that would officially recognize a palestinian state set the parameters for a two state solution and establish east jerusalem as the capital for the new palestinian state 
just a few weeks ago an article in the wall street journal entitled  obamas israel surprise  reported that this is one of the options that the obama administration is strongly considering right now a un security council resolution would be legally binding on both israel and the palestinians and it would be something that president trump would not be able to undo 
the rest of the un security council is eager to support such a resolution and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of barack obama and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do the following comes from an article by leo hohmann  
the wall street journal reported one week before tuesdays election that obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decadesold israelipalestinian conflict 
israeli diplomats according to the wsj story are preparing for the possibility that a lameduck president obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for israel and the palestinians at the united nations 
the president is presumably now reviewing those options which number about half a dozen 
he may be preparing to recognize a palestinian state at the un before he leaves office  wsj reported 
if barack obama decides to divide the land of israel at the united nations it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency i have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in america if it happens and it will also mean that many of the events that i warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating 
but if we can get to january th and the land of israel has not been divided yet we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while because trump has already said that he would not support a un security council resolution that forces a solution on the israelis and palestinians 
when politicians are going to do something that they know people wont like they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people arent paying attention for example yesterday i discussed how the legislation that created the federal reserve was rushed through congress right before christmas in   
so keep an eye on the period around thanksgiving and the period around christmas if barack obama is going to stab israel in the back it may happen during one of those times 
my hope is that we can get through january th without anything going seriously wrong if that happens i know that i will be very thankful 
and as i detailed in a previous article  donald trump will be  years  months and  days old on his first full day in office on january st and that will happen in year  on the hebrew calendar 
could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe 
or will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation 
i believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions

i will not celebrate the holidays this year screw christmas and new years already anonymous 
good on you why support corporate mandated holidays anyway thanksgiving should be the most important celebration we should also celebrate the day of the dead a solemn reminder of what the future holds for us all besides their parties are awesome ricardo 
we should also celebrate the day of the dead  that is spiritism

let the dead bury the dead matthew   meaning if you have no spiritual life you are dead so let the dead bury the dead

wrong again df nj dumb friend from new jersey god has gone to great extremes to make himself knowable when jesus died on the cross the veil of the temple was torn by god from top to bottom as a sign the way into his presence had been given put your faith in jesus follow his teaching and that path will lead you to the father and eternal life you can know god mondobeyondo

i am a political atheist just to set the record straight although i visit this site fairly often it is showing signs of paranoia and provoking fear when george w as elected there were many protesters they were just hidden away in free speech zones of course there are many unhappy people as there were in  and every election trumps votes were less than  of the  million people in the country will trump bring jobs no not unless they are govt employees or funded by taxes there is only one way jobs are created and that is when there is demand for products and services a lot of people with their low paying jobs can hardly afford the basic necessities let alone keep playing the consumerism game i cannot see obama doing anything that requires legislation as he is lame duck status now perhaps this site needs to focus on the swamp getting filled with more careerists especially lobbyists i have been an expat for over  years it is a lovely peaceful warm day here think i will go for a bicycle ride then a dip in  degree seawater i do have faith that not much will change and the sun will continue to rise even when it is obscured by clouds peace and loveit is the only way df nj 
obamas big political move will be to appoint an ultra liberal judge to the bench during the recess i just cant imagine that he doesnt leave office without punishing the republicans for not taking garland and given all the threats to taking away all of obamas legacy this is the only thing left he has to make his mark on history rick 
i dont think he can do that with a phone and pen sorry heyahuman 
could you imagine the pandemonium that would ensue if the electoral college were to vote hillary in then wed be in a real danger zone mondobeyondo 
yes it would be it would be like the krakatoa volcano erupting again df nj 
that is not going to happen because the electors hate hillary as much as you do it would be like cutting off one of your own fingers with a kitchen knife i think we are okay anonymous 
it always amazes me that people will look for signs in anything remember the world was going to end in the year  then again in  with the end of the mayan calendar 
uncertainty is the only certainty there is and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security

no longer need to look for signs as they are happening whether or not youre looking by the way    were lsm saying it was ending i guess for you the fact trump will be  years  months  days old on his first full day of office is coincidence you see coincidence believers see signs isa 
liberals have long since gone beyond activism and descended to mobs all acting like spoiled children stamping their feet and screaming i want it now its the politics of juvenile delinquency 
to be a liberal means you must lie deceive deflect and as a last resort attack a conservative 
liberalism is godlessness df nj 
you only criticize and hate on other peoples character what you do not like about your own character 
otherwise if you are able to meet people as being sacred then all you have remaining is unconditional love and acceptance of other peoples flaws

i wonder what obamas pardon list looks like jc teecher 
jesse james jackson a pawn for the left is pushing hard to have hitlery pardoned for all her crimes before she is even charged as a crook himself he has received a free pass because of his so called religious connections bull caca occult religions maybe mondobeyondo 
yes there is still a possibility that hillary clinton could still get in the oval office but a trump presidency is pretty much a done deal knock on wood the secret service had better guard him and his family very closely from what ive seen and heard president obama is trying to make trumps transition to the presidency very peaceful and orderly even though they hate each other lets hope that trumps presidency will be a successful one and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country back in  i bought a brand new book called the art of the deal at my college bookstore it was written by some guy named donald trump yes i actually did read it df nj 
not a chance hillary is dead and gone mondobeyondo 
barack obama is actually liberal enough to sign a resolution that would divide the land of israel donald trump would have to be pressured by outside forces to make such a decision would he do it dont know although from what ive heard president putin of russia likes trump a lot df nj 
we dropped  bombs on five predominately muslim countries in  maybe its time to give the yinon plan a rest and stop bombing ragheads for israel 
america first we have way too many problems and debt in this country to continue our foreign policies of american adventurism wheres pat buchanan when you need him i think its time we return to a more traditional conservative approach to foreign policy the long war does absolutely nothing to make me feel safer on the streets of newark or jersey city i say eff em america first thelulzwarrior 
who fing cares israel is not an us state so far they would simply refuse to go along such a plan paul patriot 
freedom loving americans should know what needs to happen if hitlery is said to be el presidente on december th 
the left can whine shout protest and riotits time freedom loving americans get the right mind set about standing up to tyrannyand apathy passivity fear and political correctness will prove ineffective 
the liberty tree is getting mighty thirstyjust saying df nj 
there are many forms of freedom you criticize the left but you just dont understand it heres how the left thinks 
an old english judge once said necessitous men are not free men liberty requires opportunity to make a living  a living decent according to the standard of the time a living which gives man not only enough to live by but something to live for 
for too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality a small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other peoples property other peoples money other peoples labor  other peoples lives for too many of us life was no longer free liberty no longer real men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness 
against economic tyranny such as this the american citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government  
you many not agree with this approach but all the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country the sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value 
but do not fear every year the top  become richer and richer every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a governments currency collapse once the currency collapses people in bread lines will demand more government not less

admin,2016-10-27T17:45:09.501+03:00,liberal cnn commentator blames republicans for obamacares rising premiums,"it wasnt long ago that the left represented the antiestablishment wing in politics they used to fight against globalism remember the antiglobalization movement even if their motives were different from those of todays antiglobalists as well as being against censorship imperialist wars and the expanding powers of governments and corporations but today you see leftists protesting against brexit attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using twitter on their apple products while sipping on their starbucks coffee and are calling for war in syria to challenge the russians so just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites

to understand we must go back to  when the occupy movement was ongoing the occupy protests which now seem like ages ago came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system we can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them but the important fact is that to the elites it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power
the elites were in a panic as this was the first time in postwar history that the people of west mobilized in mass to threaten their rule so the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a fullblown revolution and they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule
the diversion 
when the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere the people want to vent out their frustrations the elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up so instead of fighting it they prefer to rechannel that pent up energy elsewhere
on february  with the occupy movement still raging the elites were given that golden opportunityor rather they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in florida the none other than the infamous trayvon martin case the shooter wasnt even a full white but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it anything to divert the public attention away from them with their efforts it quickly became the biggest story of america
but they didnt stop there police shootings which have always been happening and to all races were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of black lives matter movementa movement that is financed by george soros and others to stir up unrests across america
did the elites convert occupy protesters into sjw patsies
the diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the  who were dictating their lives the occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere although i dont have as much proof as with the rise of blm movement i strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order
the strategy 
back in th century karl marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism if we were to apply this concept to the world today the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites
the goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power meanwhile they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans the worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible
my understanding of their modus operandi is this  use hotbutton issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage race issues and all other politically correct nonsense  have the leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the right  let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats  when the issue fades away foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process by cycling through them over and over again the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them
thus we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites women against men islam and atheism against christianity left against right and so on but no more antiglobalization tea party movement or occupy wall street
as long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists sexists and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government nothing will change as long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant and getting in the way of creating a decent society the people will remain divided as long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals the latest misogynist outrage or how a lion named cecil got shot the elites will continue to win
a couple more points to consider i know they look like an occupying army but theres nothing to be alarmed about theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terrorists
first while this article has been focused on how the left has been toyed by the globalist elites lets not forget that the right are not totally immune to their influence either remember how neocons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in america through faith and patriotism the support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against iraq based on bullshit evidences of wmds and saddamalqueda link while the right has changed a lot since then there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with russia because usa usa usa 
second it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule it is not the end of it the elites have far more sinister aims by raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism the elites are preparing for a total social control i get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control
no matter their differences when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the us government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens  a leaked soros memo also reveals that the blm movement is potentially being used to federalize the us police  while many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future
the culture wars necessary fight or engineered distraction 
the issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites
on one hand we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists zionists  bankers megacorporations  and the governments from undermining our existence really do the issues of politicallyincorrect halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middleclass is being destroyed revelations of massive corruption in the dnc the coming policestate and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world all the drama of outrage and counteroutrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape
on the other hand culture does matter in many ways uncontrolled immigration antimale laws and censorship are all very relevant issues and as much of the leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model i described above in a way we are now forced to fight the left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites
so does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their sjw drones i dont have a good answer but whatever we choose to do i believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on we should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind
conclusion is there still hope 
although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization the current us election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment to me that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class
with bernie sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps the only antiestablishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by donald trump this is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down trump and use disgruntled leftists against his supporters
i have my doubts about trump  but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that hillary clinton will bring to america and the world if she gets elected but besides voting i believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us we cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny

theodore roosevelt was born oct   his wife and mother died on valentines day feb   he wrote in his diary the light has gone out in my life depressed he left to ranch in the dakotas 
returning to new york he entered politics and rose to assistant secretary of the navy he resigned during the spanishamerican war organized the first volunteer cavalry the rough riders and captured cubas san juan hill elected vicepresident under william mckinley he became americas youngest president in  
republican theodore roosevelt was the first president to invite an africanamerican booker t washington to dine in the white house on oct   a southern democrat newspapers condemned him it as printed in the memphis scimitar the most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the united states was committed yesterday by the president when he invited a n to dine with him at the white house it would not be worth more than a passing notice if theodore roosevelt had sat down to dinner in his own home with a pullman car porter but roosevelt the individual and roosevelt the president are not to be viewed in the same light 
in  theodore roosevelt warned the thought of modern industry in the hands of christian charity is a dream worth dreaming the thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining the choice between the two is upon us 
in  the new york bible society had theodore roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket new testament  book of psalms given to world war i soldiers the teachings of the new testament are foreshadowed in micahs verse micah vi  what more does the lord require of thee than to do justice and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god do justice and therefore fight valiantly against the armies of germany and turkey for these nations in this crisis stand for the reign of moloch and beelzebub on this earth love mercy treat prisoners well succor the wounded treat every woman as if she was your sister care for the little children and be tender to the old and helpless walk humbly you will do so if you study the life and teachings of the saviour may the god of justice and mercy have you in his keeping  signed theodore roosevelt

theodore roosevelt in his book fear god and take your own part ny george h doran co  wrote 
armenians  for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war  are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors the turks have not been pacifists but militarists t roosevelt fear god p   
armenians have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the napoleonic warsthe wars of genghis khan and tamerlane in asia yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged  this course of national infamy  began when the last administration surrendered to the peace atanyprice people and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milkandwater invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of bloodandiron t roosevelt fear god p  
american eyewitness of the fearful atrocities mr arthur h gleason new york tribune nov   serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish now the armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an oldtime apache indian  
even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heapedup horrors of the past year and a half the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds  if this people through its government had not shirked its duty  we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of armenia 
mass meetings on behalf of the armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them  the principles of the peaceatanyprice men of the professional pacifists  will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness  this crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the armenians  must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the united states for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed  the devastation of poland and serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenthcentury europe  
weak and timid milkandwater policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the bloodandiron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the armenians they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of attila and of genghis khan 
it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks neutral not only in deed but in thought between right and the most hideous wrong neutral between despairing and hunted people people whose little children are murdered and their women raped and the victorious and evil wrongdoers  
i trust that all americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful armenian atrocities i trust that they feel  that a peace obtained without  righting the wrongs of the armenians would be worse than any war  
wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just who put honor above safety who are true to a lofty ideal of duty who prepare in advance to make their strength effective and who shrink from no hazard not even the final hazard of war if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness when our people take this stand we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesseson an even greater scale in armenia t roosevelt fear god pp  
in his book fear god and take your part  theodore roosevelt wrote 
christianity is not the creed of asia and africa at this moment solely because the seventh century christians of asia and africa had trained themselves not to fight whereas the moslems were trained to fight christianity was saved in europe solely because the peoples of europe fought 
if the peoples of europe in the th and th centuries and on up to and including the th century had not possessed a military equality with and gradually a growing superiority over the mohammedans who invaded europe europe would at this moment be mohammedan and the christian religion would be exterminated 
a contemporary of theodore roosevelt was the english author gk chesterton who wrote of western christian civilization the collected works of gk chesterton volume xx introduction and notes by james v schall ignatius press they seem entirely to forget that long before the crusaders had dreamed of riding to jerusalem the moslems had almost ridden into paris 
theodore roosevelt continued in fear god and take your part  wherever the mohammedans have had complete sway wherever the christians have been unable to resist them by the sword christianity has ultimately disappeared from the hammer of charles martel to the sword of jan sobieski christianity owed its safety in europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the mohammedan aggressor

Alex Ansary,2016-10-27T15:31:55.537+03:00,opinion economics is a form of brain damage,"netflix ceo tvs future includes hallucination pills  
independent 
the future of tv might everyone taking hallucinogenic drugs according to the head of netflix 
the threats to the streaming tv company might not be amazon or other streaming services but instead pharmacological ways of entertaining people reed hastings has said 
and just as films and tv shows are a supposedly improved version of other entertainments those same things might eventually become defunct he said in the same way that the cinema and tv screen made the opera and the novel much smaller something else might be on the way to do the same thing the netflix boss said at a wall street journal event 
those challenges could come from anywhere he said they might not be another form of screen is it vr is it gaming is it pharmacological mr hastings asked the event 
he went on to say that it might be possible that in the coming years someone will develop a drug that will make people get the same experiences that at the moment come from streaming services like netflix apparently making reference to the matrix he said that we might be able to take one pill to escape into a hallucination and then another to come back 
in twenty or fifty years taking a personalized blue pill you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable mr hastings said and if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological well be in real trouble 
his references to the matrix  and to being in trouble  recall arguments that have recently been made by tech billionaires including elon musk and sam altman both have suggested that it might be possible that we are part of a simulated universe  something that they said might be part of a virtual reality world but could just as easily be the result of a druginduced hallucination 
mr hastings didnt indicate whether or not netflix would look to make such drugs itself or how it would fend off any companies that did but it does sound a little like something out black mirror which netflix is showing the new season of at the moment",english,amtvmedia.com,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-shot-2013-08-09-at-8.01.03-AM.jpg,bs,0.0,opinion economics form brain damage,netflix ceo tvs future includes hallucination pills independent future tv might everyone taking hallucinogenic drugs according head netflix threats streaming tv company might amazon streaming services instead pharmacological ways entertaining people reed hastings said films tv shows supposedly improved version entertainments things might eventually become defunct said way cinema tv screen made opera novel much smaller something else might way thing netflix boss said wall street journal event challenges could come anywhere said might another form screen vr gaming pharmacological mr hastings asked event went say might possible coming years someone develop drug make people get experiences moment come streaming services like netflix apparently making reference matrix said might able take one pill escape hallucination another come back twenty fifty years taking personalized blue pill hallucinate entertaining way white pill brings back normality perfectly viable mr hastings said source human entertainment thirty forty years pharmacological well real trouble references matrix trouble recall arguments recently made tech billionaires including elon musk sam altman suggested might possible part simulated universe something said might part virtual reality world could easily result druginduced hallucination mr hastings didnt indicate whether netflix would look make drugs would fend companies sound little like something black mirror netflix showing new season moment,1.0

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-31T05:57:53.998+02:00,hillary campaign launching attacks on the fbi,"americans seek to help persecuted christians  government helps muslims the people of the united states get it but the obama administration could care less october   
originally published by the gatestone institute raymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
as the muslim persecution of christians continues to reach critical proportions around the world see report below the average american shows much more concern than the current administration soon after it was revealed that the obama administration has taken in  muslim refugees but only  christianseven though christians are approximately  percent of syrias population and are classified as experiencing a genocide therea poll found that more than three quarters of american respondents agreed with the statement it is important to me that the next us president be committed to addressing the persecution that some christians face around the world eg imprisonment beheadings rape loss of home and assets 
the deliberate targeting and killing of christians in europe also reached unprecedented levels in modern times most notably on the morning of july   allahu akbar  shouting muslims stormed a small church in france during morning mass they forced yearold fr jacques hamel to his knees slit his throat and  critically injured  a nun before being killed by police it was later revealed that police had known that church was being targeted and had even been monitoring one of the murderers for at least oneandahalf years 
later when a journalist asked pope francis if fr jacques was  killed in the name of islam  the pope disagreed he argued that he hears of christians committing violence every day in italy this one who has murdered his girlfriend another who has murdered the motherinlaw and these are baptized catholics there are violent catholics if i speak of islamic violence i must speak of catholic violence the logic of the popes statement seems to be that violence done in direct contradiction of the judeochristian gods commandmentssuch as the murder of wives and mothersinlawis identical to violence done in accordance with allahs commandments to wage jihad on infidels 
in isiscontrolled territories in iraq and syria reports of christians being tortured to convert maimed crucified burned alive beheaded or sold into sex slavery continued to emerge in iraq a report says that christians and other minorities in iraq are facing persecution at unprecedented levels and are at the verge of extinction  the christian population has dwindled from  million to  in the last decade according to some estimates however minority rights group put that the number at anywhere between  to  
a former isis member exposed some of the atrocities the group commits in syria they were extremely brutal killing women and the elderly who did not obey them they abused and mutilated their dead bodies they cut up the corpses tied them to the back of the cars and dragged them along they would find them and publicly execute them i witnessed many executions 
the remainder of julys roundup of muslim persecution of christiansmost of which was not committed by isisincludes but is not limited to the following muslim slaughter of christians

islamic state  isis has been making use of social mediaincluding facebook and mobile apps like whatapp and telegram to sell enslaved christian and yazidi girls to a wider network of sadists and pedophiles one telegram posting showed a picture of a young girl with the caption virgin beautiful  years old the posting states her price has reached  and she will be sold soon 
nigeria another report says that the muslim terrorist group boko haram has murdered  people almost all of whom were christian for refusing to convert to islam they also forced  women and young girls to marry their fighters

turkey  during the july  failed coup attempt at least two churches were attacked  one of the attacks happened in trabzon a group of  people attacked santa maria church with paving stones and hammers to smash the windows said the report one church leader in istanbul said im not optimistic about the plight of christians in turkey bear in mind weve had a roman catholic bishop murdered weve had clergy threatened weve had one priest murdered  years ago any christian leader if theyre being honest would say that some of whats going on is quite alarming

egypt  after a christian man was stabbed to death and many christian homes and a church burned by angry muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built coptic christian bishop makarious of alminya was interviewed on television church authorities in egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say but makarious made many revealing comments although only christians no muslims were killed and hurt he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as clasheswhich suggests two quarrelling partieswhen the reality is always that one side attacks the other within minutes of the start of one of the attacks  muslims instantly appeared fully armed as if ready for war he added as long as the attackers are never punished and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty this will just encourage others to continue the attacks since even if they are arrested they will be quickly released when the host asked questions about who is released and why suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the christians the bishop replied well what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested with complete proofs and evidences against them but then they are still declared innocent and released this happens every single time about this series 
the persecution of christians in the islamic world has become endemic accordingly muslim persecution of christians was developed to collate someby no means allof the instances of persecution that surface each month it serves two purposes 
 to document that which the mainstream media does not the habitual if not chronic persecution of christians 
 to show that such persecution is not random but systematic and interrelatedthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by islamic sharia 
accordingly whatever the anecdote of persecution it typically fits under a specific theme including hatred for churches and other christian symbols apostasy blasphemy and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who offend islam sexual abuse of christian women forced conversions to islam theft and plunder in lieu of jizya financial tribute expected from nonmuslims overall expectations for christians to behave like cowed dhimmis  or thirdclass tolerated citizens and simple violence and murder sometimes it is a combination thereof 
because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities languages and localesfrom morocco in the west to indonesia in the eastit should be clear that one thing alone binds them islamwhether the strict application of islamic sharia law or the supremacist culture born of it

trump fans may have won the election but they arent taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of michelle obama the donalds deplorables were out in force after the first lady posed for the cover of vogue 
i could have spent eight years doing anything  and at some level it would have been fine obama told the magazine  i could have focused on flowers i could have focused on decor i could have focused on entertainment because any first lady rightfully gets to define her role theres no legislative authority youre not elected and thats a wonderful gift of freedom 
in exercising her freedom michelle obama has done quite a bit to push education healthy eating and support for our veterans  and in exercising their freedom the right has responded with nothing but hate the reaction to the first lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical readers of yahoo news showered obama with racist remarks calling her an ape and a monkey and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes 
if you thought this behavior would stop after the election you were wrong trump fans are not done by a long shot  and now they have been emboldened by america electing its first official kkk candidate

the trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose florida they will lose the election but the signs are evident in the polling that the republican party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the white house in november 
a trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for republicans that leads to additional democratic senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority republicans could see their current record house majority gutted in a clinton landslide 
the election is not getting better for republicans the landscape is getting worse if this polling continues for another week at the state level democrats could be looking at their best case scenario of a democratic white house house and senate being in play",english,naturalnews.com,http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/640/Food/Assorted-Fruits-Vegetables-Food.jpg,junksci,0.0,clear heart blockages powerful lemon garlic mixture,thu oct th pm another day life donald trumps presidential campaign share twitter print post standard day life donald trumps presidential campaign republican nominee spent much time campaign trail thursday making outrageous insulting comments clear display rally toledo ohio trump proposed one ridiculous ideas yet cancel election anoint president video trump jokes cancel election give trump right even policies bad pictwittercomstzidbpf bradd jaffy braddjaffy october im thinking right cancel election give trump right trump asked crowd even policies bad despite trumps plea cancel election continues struggle polls voters decide candidate better policies thankfully remark also aligns closely recent comments trump claimed process rigged accept outcome election favorable trump wasnt done buckeye state rally also made sure take dig minority communities video help trump say going work ghettos mentioning inner cities violence african americans pictwittercomvkqzslbh bradd jaffy braddjaffy october trumps comments gonna work ghettos take look whats going pockets areas land inner cities many things many problems many horrible horrible problems violence death lack education jobs gonna work africanamerican community going solve problem inner city cant walk street buy loaf bread end getting shot republican nominees ghetto comment newest addition standard trump narrative black communities hellscapes particular set remarks comes day visited north carolina rally told supporters mostly white would enact new deal black america closing days election donald trump showing better version man built campaign racial resentment doubling election season comes conclusion,1.0
Beau Albrecht,2016-11-16T04:00:00.000+02:00,the sad saga of john walker lindh rebel without a clue,"in an excerpt of a john pilger special interview julian assange says that emails released by wikileaks show that hillary clinton is intentionally misguiding voters about the degree to which us allies are supporting isis and that donald trump will not be allowed into the oval office
assange explains that the same financial interests funding isis are funding clinton he references a  email from john podesta to clinton in which we find the following
while this militaryparamilitary operation is moving forward we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of qatar and saudi arabia which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil and other radical sunni groups in the region

i think this is the most significant email in the whole collection said assange all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis
pilger asked assange about the possibility that trump would steal the election with the help of russia as many in the democratic party claim
assange thinks that this is highly unlikely but not because he is unpopular my analysis is that trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because he has had every establishment off his side trump does not have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them establishment he explained
assange says that hillary is the establishment pick banks intelligence arms companies foreign money etc are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and the journalists themselves delivered by the daily sheeple

the nras magazine acknowledged that president obama really hasnt had the opportunity to confiscate firearms undercutting years of fearmongering about the supposed existence of a  massive obama conspiracy  to dismantle the second amendment and take guns away 
the nras admission that a president cant confiscate guns because congress writes the laws not the president also demonstrates the implausibility of repeated recent claims from the nra that link hillary clinton to gun confiscation 
the admission was included in a june  article for nra magazine americas st freedom which took issue with how obama rudely responded to a question from a gun store owner at a recent town hall event 
the article quoted obama as telling the questioner im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
responding to obamas statement the article acknowledged now the gun store ownercould have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president 
rhude didnt sit down after asking his question rather he stood silently as president obama didnt even try to answer his question but instead went off on a defensive tirade first of all the notion that i or hillary or democrats or whoever you want to choose are hellbent on taking away folks guns is just not true and i dont care how many times the nra says it 
obama then said im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
now rhude could have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president he could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms  from operation fast and furious to operation choke point to obamas attempted ban on common ammunition for artype rifles to his using a pen and phone to push antigun executive actions but rhude respectfully stayed silent 
claims about gun confiscation and obama have been the nras bread and butter for the past eight years  more recently the nra has suggested that the election of clinton could lead to gun confiscation for lawabiding americans

remington researchs summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become increasingly competitive 
last week we found a presidential race where hillary clinton held a clear advantage this week we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go trump appears to be holding strong in his mustwin states and colorado remains within the margin of error the data also show that pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category 
the presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch hillary maintains an advantage leading in colorado and pennsylvania but at this point anything can happen said titus bond director of remington research group 
other state polling data came out on sunday that also showed a closerace between trump and clinton although the polls were surveyed before fbi director james comeys announcement that they were reopening their investigation against clinton  via realclearpolitics  florida new york timessiena trump  percent clinton  percent nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent colorado cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent arizona cbsyougov trump  percent clinton  percent north carolina nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent pennsylvania cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent 
the fact that some of these polls were close even before the comey announcement led to this observation from fivethirtyeights nate silver both things can be true  comey impact overblown  nate silver natesilver october   
radio host steve deace writes at conservative review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of clinton the renewed fbi investigation could have a potentially huge impact on election day 
trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like arizona georgia utah indiana and alaska that rarely go blue on election day its quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the clintons could sway the bulk of republicanleaning undecideds trumps way but thats provided of course that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as hes been prone to do then theres the matter of trumps emerging evan mcmullin headache in utah 
if trump can be disciplined this final week his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on iowa nevada florida ohio and north carolina those five states would get him within striking distance to  electoral college votes and then you hope you can pull an upset in colorado pennsylvania or new mexico where trump is visiting during the campaigns final week the hope is that theres enough voters in those states wearier of clintons corruption than worried about whether trumps fit for office

donald trump raised just  million for his presidential campaign committee in the first  days of october about half as much as his democratic rival putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the white house contest new campaign finance reports filed thursday night showed 
the gop presidential nominee had just  million left in his campaign coffers on oct  compared to hillary clintons  million when the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included clintons war chest grew to  million while trumps totaled  million 
trumps total fundraising dropped  in the first  days of october  million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race at a time when trump needs boots on the ground to get out the republican vote his presidential campaign is broke and in debt to the tune of  million there isnt going to be a lastminute ad blitz for trump or a reservation of television time so that the republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day 
the plan for trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies which are good for trumps ego but not effective in getting voters to the polls trump promised to donate  million to his campaign but has only given  million  the billionaire who promised to selffinance has run his presidential campaign into the ground trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in october 
fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes the money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election hillary clinton is having no trouble raising money which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters trumps cash crush points to a depressed base that doesnt expect him to win

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-03T06:48:44.984+02:00,majority of americans side with fbi over hillary,"go to article 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
once upon a time factchecking meant that newspapers radio stations and television news broadcasts were obligated to check their facts before broadcasting or publishing them some newspapers and magazines boasted renowned departments filled with intellectuals whose restless minds roved over each line to ensure that the fewest possible errors would appear under that publications masthead 
but factchecking of the media by itself has declined almost as badly as the roman empire errors routinely appear under storied mastheads followed by corrections that are published as a janitorial duty there is very little concern for the facts even among the great names of publishing and broadcasting 
the media has stopped factchecking itself and it now uses factchecking largely to refer to a type of opinion journalism in which it checks the facts of public figures the fall of factchecking within the media has paralleled the rise of fact checking by the media of its political opponents the media has become factless even as it deploys a term that once meant selfcorrection to instead correct others 
fact checks once meant that reporters were expected to be accurate these days theyre only expected to be politically correct the media deploys fact checks to check political correctness not facts its fact checks routinely venture into areas that are not only partisan but subjective matters of opinion 
consider politicos often mocked fact check of donald trump as to whether isis was indeed unbelievably evil under a banner headline donald trumps week of misrepresentations exaggerations and halftruths it zoomed in on a quote from his florida rally 
were presiding over something that the world has not seen the level of evil is unbelievable trump had said 
politico swooped in to correct the candidate with its fact check judging one level of evil against another is subjective but other groups in recent history have without any question engaged in as widespread killing of civilians as isis 
there were no facts being checked here because politico doesnt seem to know what a fact even is 
the only information conveyed by this fact check is that politico like the rest of the media does not like donald trump and would find a way to argue with him if he said that the sky was blue 
in the daily show media culture where overt bias and trolling are virtues factchecking is just another snotty variety of editorializing that attempts to compensate for perceptions of bias not with higher ethical and factual standards but by rebranding its editorials as fact checks to gain credibility 
the isis evil fact check of trump came from the same media outlet whose white house reporter decided that the wisconsin flag which carries the date  to mark the states admission to the union was a flag for the local union wisconsin  politico ran an entire story asserting that obama was flying a labor flag to oppose governor walker because its reporter couldnt process basic history 
this is what happens when media outlets think that factchecking is something that they do to republicans rather than to themselves 
factchecking was one of those dinosaurs of journalism like objectivity which is viewed as largely irrelevant in a media culture whose edward r murrow is jon stewart todays millennial journalists spend most of their time exchanging sarcastic quips with their peers on twitter aspire to found their own vox sites and write viral blog posts that seek a new angle on a trending leftwing narrative 
fact checks often function as narrative defenses and meme attacks thats why the washington post decided to fact check a saturday night live gag about obamas illegal alien amnesty its not that anyone imagines that saturday night live is in the business of producing facts that need checking the post was just worried that one of its jokes would go viral and hurt obama and his agenda 
its the same reason that the paper fact checked a yearold boy who claimed he was blocked by obama on twitter this isnt about the facts its paranoia about social media narratives going viral 
this is more understandable if you stop thinking of the media in the oldfashioned sense as a series of papers radio and television stations and start thinking of it as a massive machine that advocates for leftwing policies using its massive infrastructure and wealth to monopolize internet narratives 
media outlets trade on their history but they dont resemble their past selves in any meaningful way 
the new yorker once boasted a factchecking department that was famous for its range its depth and its resourcefulness in running down even the most obscure facts but what use is such a thing at david remnicks new yorker whose big draw comes from andy borowitzs insipid near parodies the new republic went from respected liberal publication to another snarky and shrill social justice blog cbs news cited a psychic site to explain that a fly landed on hillarys face to help her cope with stress 
this isnt material that exists in the same realm as facts its snarky contempt alternating with lowest common denominator propaganda leftwing journalism like most leftwing culture is totalitarian antiintellectualism masquerading as enlightened intellectualism the soviet union was quite fond of culture it just hated the creative process that produced it because it was independent of communist ideology the left loves journalism it just hates the objectivity that validates journalism as more than propaganda 
its this perverse antiintellectualism that turned factchecking from selfdiscipline to attack ad once journalism became pure leftwing advocacy it also became inherently correct by virtue of being leftwing and was not in need of having its facts checked when fact checks stopped being something that journalists did to themselves first facts and then fact checks became meaningless unable to even recognize a fact media fact checkers just wrote editorials which spiced their leftwing attacks on republicans liberally with cargo cult invocations to fact as if it were some deity 
the average media fact check is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy for thinking adults 
at the washington post  michelle yee fact checks donald trumps comment that hillarys email scandal is bigger than watergate and concludes that since watergate led to nixons resignation and hillarys email scandal has yet to lead to any convictions it cant be bigger than watergate since the scandal has yet to be resolved a fact check of it could only take place in the future 
cnn featured toronto star fact checker daniel dale who claimed that trump said  lies in one day 
the list of lies included deeming trumps statement that hillary would raise taxes false because her plan only taxes the rich asserting that there is no such thing as a phony poll and denying that hillary clinton had received debate questions some of these lies are themselves lies others like yee show an inability to even understand what a fact is and what can and cant be deemed false 
just how degraded fact checking had become was made manifest when hillary clinton pleaded at the debate please fact checkers get to work her campaign site touted its own fact checking which was mostly indistinguishable from the medias fact checking that was a commentary on the transformation of the media into a leftwing politicians spin center 
nearly every media outlet now boasts a fact check blog or headlines touting fact checks but the biggest fact checking department of the media rather than by the media isnt in the united states but in germany in america fact checking has become a type of partisan attack launched by media outlets at their political opponents its bigger than ever and also more worthless than ever because it is factless

for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps and yet youll ask me that question i think thats a very rude question to be honest with you trump exclaimed 
trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit

Alex Ansary,2016-11-07T02:09:02.970+02:00,the man behind the trump rally disturbance in reno,"us military hackers claim penetration of russia  
sputnik news 
us military hackers have penetrated russias electric grid telecommunications networks and kremlins command systems making them vulnerable to attack by secret american cyber weapons according to a series of reports by a major us television network 
nbc news disclosed the penetration in a series of reports explaining that us efforts parallel claims also by us officials that russia china and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of us critical infrastructure 
the penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an allout war in cyberspace according to nbc news which said it was briefed by a us intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents 
at the same time the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to us adversaries 
nbc news then attempted to link its explosive report to tuesdays us presidential election citing concerns of mischief by russian hackers that would fall far short of the armageddonlike scenario that the report implied 
instead the network explained us electionrelated concerns as cyber mischief which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation 
the obama administration has created a public but unconfirmed narrative that hackers controlled by the russian government have stolen emails from the democratic party headquarters a private computer used by presidential candidate hillary clinton while serving as secretary of state and computers used by clinton campaign chairman john podesta 
according to the narrative russia stole the emails and gave the messages to wikileaks which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to tuesdays election 
russia has denied any responsibility for the clintonrelated hacks and links between wikileaks and russian intelligence have never been substantiated 
moreover recent media reports in the united states indicate that clintons private server she used for official business during her tenure as secretary of state had been penetrated by at least five foreign intelligence services 
the emails have proved especially embarrassing for the clinton campaign by disclosing decisions in the clinton state department that favored large donors to the clinton foundation in what appear to be payforplay schemes of selling access and influence 
moreover the activity appears to coincide with lucrative speaking engagements for former president bill clinton",english,amtvmedia.com,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/636139958247519037-AP-Campaign-2016-Trump-001.jpg,bs,0.0,man behind trump rally disturbance reno,us military hackers claim penetration russia sputnik news us military hackers penetrated russias electric grid telecommunications networks kremlins command systems making vulnerable attack secret american cyber weapons according series reports major us television network nbc news disclosed penetration series reports explaining us efforts parallel claims also us officials russia china nations placed hidden malware parts us critical infrastructure penetration sides appears preparation allout war cyberspace according nbc news said briefed us intelligence official given opportunity review highly classified documents time network downplayed prospect cyber war making appear leak intended warning us adversaries nbc news attempted link explosive report tuesdays us presidential election citing concerns mischief russian hackers would fall far short armageddonlike scenario report implied instead network explained us electionrelated concerns cyber mischief could involve releasing fake documents creating bogus social media accounts spread misinformation obama administration created public unconfirmed narrative hackers controlled russian government stolen emails democratic party headquarters private computer used presidential candidate hillary clinton serving secretary state computers used clinton campaign chairman john podesta according narrative russia stole emails gave messages wikileaks flooded internet material daily basis leading tuesdays election russia denied responsibility clintonrelated hacks links wikileaks russian intelligence never substantiated moreover recent media reports united states indicate clintons private server used official business tenure secretary state penetrated least five foreign intelligence services emails proved especially embarrassing clinton campaign disclosing decisions clinton state department favored large donors clinton foundation appear payforplay schemes selling access influence moreover activity appears coincide lucrative speaking engagements former president bill clinton,1.0

Sean Brown,2016-11-04T19:14:00.000+02:00,breaking wikileaks reveals hillarys campaign chair engages in satanic rituals,"posted on october   blacks and liberals want to abolish science dan roodt american renaissance october   the south african fallist movement finds another target 
on my recent visit to stockholm for the identitarian conference some swedes and i compared notes on whose country was the most crazyliberal and antiwhite the swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an ngo that said swedes should integrate into the culture of thirdworld immigrants to form a new country 
my swedish colleagues agreed with french author renaud camus writing on free west media  he argues that whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by thirdworlders the case of sweden is even more tragic more extreme more insane nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide 
but i believe south africa is worse we have actual laws regulations and policies that require corporations universities and sports bodies to replace whites our country has become the world champion of antiwhite antiwestern ideology together with our northern neighbor zimbabwe we are to multiculturalism what pol pots shortlived democratic kampuchea was to communism its most extreme expression pol pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of cambodia in order to start a new society 
south africas ruling elite also wants a new society that will be cleansed of western influences and even the white race as robert mugabe put it during his famous  visit to soweto i dont want to see a white face 
the current upheavals at our universitiesknown absurdly as the fallist movementhave been widely reported enraged black students egged on by understanding whites have demanded that one thing after another must fall each accompanied by its own hashtag first it was rhodesmustfall the statue of cecil rhodes at the university of cape town then afrikaansmustfall blacks want to eliminate afrikaans as a language of university instruction followed by feesmustfall they want tuition fees abolished and now sciencemustfall 
in a video that has had nearly a million views a female black student at the university of cape town called for science to be scrapped saying 
if i personally were committed to decolonization science as a whole is a product of western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off so if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science we have to restart science fromi dont knowfrom an african perspective from our perspective from how weve experienced science for instance i have a question for all the science people there is a place in kzn called umhlabuyalingana they believe that through the magic the black magicyou call it black magic they call it witchcraftyou are able to send lightening to strike someone can you explain that scientifically because its something that happens 
the initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites but i knew that her dismissal of western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the culturalmarxist ideas swirling through most western universities after all herbert marcuse one of the founders of cultural marxism wrote this in an essay on liberation in  at the height of us student radicalism 
this is the hippie subculture tripgrasspotacid and so on but a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants here is a systematic linguistic rebellion which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined and places them into the opposite contextnegation of the established one thus the blacks take over some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of western civilization desublimate and redefine them p  
needless to say marcuse approved of the black take over and if he were alive today he would surely applaud what is happening in south africa not only are blacks taking over western concepts and changing them into their opposites they are taking over our institutions as well 
in universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young fallist i was only slightly surprised to read a piece in afrikaans entitled  sciencemustfall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink  sciencemustfall not so ridiculous as it sounds it was written by liezel de lange the managing director of our sunday newspaper rapport  which once supported apartheid and segregation 
miss de lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the university of pretoria in the days when it still taught western ideas and culture she laments that when she studied english literature almost all our prescribed works were from britain and ireland as well as the usa i have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from wole soyinka chinua achebe and ngugi wa thiongo most westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught ngugi wa thiongo 
although liezel de lange did not exactly endorse the sciencemustfall idea in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical medieval african university of timbuktu as evidence that africas vast contributions to world learning are being ignored in fact timbuktu was a center for islamic and tuareg schools not a hub of forgotten african or black science nor are africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the medieval african university recent al qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the new yorker recently ran a story called  has the great library of timbuktu been lost  
i asked liezel de lange on twitter whether she was an afrocentrist but she evaded the question answering that she merely posits that not all knowledge wisdom and insight come from the west its hard to disagree with that 
miss de langes column was just a watereddown version of a more radical piece she had read on the leftwing website the daily maverick by joel modiri called  in the fall decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in south africa  
mr modiri is a black academic at unisa university of south africa which has been racially transformedmeaning that whites have been all but banished it is africas largest correspondence university naturally founded by south african whites mr modiri explained that her the fallists error proves her point he decried 
the presentation of knowledge by south african universities as predominantly the product of the west and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines medicine physics astronomy mathematics among others have deep heritages in africa china and india     
in other words she is a victim of the false eurocentric view that science is western to begin with some american blacks have long maintained that the west stole its knowledge from africa they never explain how science could be stolen from one people by another leaving no trace behind knowledge is not like the mona lisa which cannot exist in more than one place so it is strange that the wise africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was stolen from them 
but we have to remember samuel huntingtons dictum in his book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order  culture follows power if anything this is what the rest of the world might learn from south africa whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs even if they are more primitive than those it replaces once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor 
unfortunately it is not only pseudointellectual blacks such as mr modiri who hate the west one of the most europhobic statements in support of the black uct student came from stuart theobald a whiteliberal english south african academic who divides his time between london and johannesburg 
in the same rapport that liezel de lange edits mr theobald writes of the need to decolonize science because it has been used to justify racism and to support biological racism he continues 
we are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today this is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and south african universities have the opportunity to lead the charge 
he adds that we need a new paradigm in science that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology and that a postcolonial science that is shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking will solve problems that now baffle us he notes the fuss made over the fallist students comments and then asks but when you see the entanglement of racism and science can you blame her

Shawn Helton,2016-10-29T04:22:00.000+03:00,fbi redux whats behind new probe into hillary clinton emails,"a tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the clinton campaign as the  presidential election draws to a close 
meltdown the clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details photo illustration wire 
over the weekend it was discovered through a wikileaks email dump that neera tanden of the center for american progress  john podesta s top aide had an email exchange with michael lux of progressive strategies revealing that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners was closely allied with clinton campaign manager robby mook  
political bombshell clinton campaign manager robby mook had close ties to disgraced dnc consultant robert creamer image source lockerdome  
creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit project veritas  not only was it revealed that the creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at donald trump rallies on camera  he also met with white house officials some  times over the past year including  private meetings with president obama or other senior officials 
dnc scandal robert creamer of democracy partners and democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky image source national vanguard  
creamers visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky  
white house visitor records have shown that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the clinton campaign and the dnc plausible deniability 
the mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair donna brazile  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates brazile stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario 
donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show 
the article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim dnc chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined 
in the march  exchange brazile mentions roland martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign 
ill send a few more though some questions roland submitted brazile wrote to palmieri in the march  email thread which is entitled from time to time i get the questions in advance 
martin is a commentator for tv one and the host of news one now  as well as a cnn contributor 
in another matter the wall street journal revealed the following  while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the fbi and doj while the fbi appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments 
the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor they had recovered a laptop many of the  emails on the computer they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter 
some critics have called for mccabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received  from a wellknown clinton confidant terry mcauliffe  this was further underlined after the house oversight commitee wanted more information about the senate campaign of dr jill mccabe and its ties to the clintons 
the alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the clinton email server case this past week  something that added to the lynchclinton tarmac meeting before the first fbi ruling in the clinton case 
according to a report filed by zero hedge  a close friend of podesta peter kadzik  the assistant attorney general of the department of justice doj will be in charge of a probe into huma abedin  clintions closest aide 
interestingly as a mountain of controversy envelops the clinton campaign the fbi is now conducting an early inquiry into former trump campaign manager paul manafort  over his alleged foreign business connections 
back in august the following business connection was revealed by nbc news  
in  according to court records senior trump aide paul manaforts firm was involved with a ukrainian oligarch named dmytro firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous new york hotel the drake the total value of the project was  million firtashs company planned to invest over  million the records say 
that same year firtash acknowledged to the us ambassador in ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious russian crime lord according to a classified state department cable other cables say firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between russia and the ukraine 
although the us state department has determined that firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in russia  so far theres nothing directly linking manafort to any underground element at this time 
watch this space  as the russiatrump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the clinton campaign meltdown

Nathaniel Mauka,2016-10-31T13:39:19.299+02:00,distracted by election  noone resisted the deep states patriot act,"michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

cabreras attorney stephen bronis said given to the clintongore campaign was not intended to buy protection for drug smuggling he had a lobster and stone crab fishery in the keys and felt that contribution might promote that future course bronis said the clintongore campaign only returned the  last week after the full story had reached abc news and the clinton administration had been asked for comment by the media cabrera was arrested in january during a miami drug bust of nearly three tons of cocaine cabrera was arrested and pleaded guilty to one drug count he was also imprisoned in the s on narcotics charges a report that the picture of cabrera and gore had been impounded by the justice department prompted an angry reaction from republicans including bob doles presidential campaign house speaker newt gingrich and rep bob livingston of louisiana chairman of the house appropriations committee republicans sent letters to attorney general janet reno and the directors of the fbi and the secret service seeking information about cabrera and the campaign contribution livingston asked the federal agencies for a complete accounting of the facts relating to the story within three days whether cabrera had dined at the white house details of his relationship with clinton and gore and if he did dine with them how he passed fbi  secret service scrutiny to gain access to them the us attorneys office in miami was contacted by reporters justice said it would not provide photographs of cabrera and gore in florida and at the white house when reporters requested them on monday the justice department attempted to claim that cabreras story is covered by the privacy act law in turning down the media request for information on the arrest for cocaine possession of tons of the illegal drug and dealing janet reno put out information that the photo of cabrera with gore and clinton could not be released without the consent of cabrera later the justice department did release the photographs after cabrera submitted written authorization the delay by the justice department appeared to be an effort to distance itself from accusations that are mounting from the american public that the justice department is receiving guidance from the clinton white house and the vice presidents office on the timing of janet renos investigation justice says it is looking into the breach of national security by cabreras ready access to secured areas of the white house and its grounds when he entered as an invited quest of president clinton for dinner and photoops

insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate fisher  mins ago news comments off on hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate hillary clinton stood before millions of americans last night and told numerous lies then said things like google it suggesting we fact check herso we did and found  major lies plus others fact check   hillary clinton claimed that planned parenthood provides cancer screenings and therefore should not be defunded in spite of controversy about abortion factcheck mostly false this is a repeated claim deployed in defense of planned parenthood but it is not true at least as regards breast cancer as the leftleaning washington post s factchecker wrote in  when democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that planned parenthood provides mammograms this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the xrays the group does not provide mammograms rather the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies xrays or other specialized services it is slightly more accurate to say that women have access to mammograms via planned parenthood though its still slippery language fact check   hillary clinton responded to a question about supreme court and gun rights by saying i support the second amendment factcheck false when clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the district of columbia v heller  decision a decision dealing with the foundations of the second amendment the very roots of what it protects in the heller ruling scotus reaffirmed that the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms this decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia politics and journalism trying to persuade americans that the second amendment protects a collective right if collective the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or todays military or police forces so heller is crucial in fact it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire second amendment rests on it yet hillary disagrees the heller ruling her spokesman josh schwerin said hillary believes heller was  wrongly decided  so how can a woman who does not believe in an individual right to keep and bear arms support the second amendment she cant incidentally clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the heller decision was the way the scotus applied the second amendment in that case for those of you who may not know heller centered on washington dcs gun banwhich was subsequently struck down via the scotus decision to oppose the application of the second amendment in heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned that is not supporting the second amendment fact check   hillary clinton said during the third presidential debate in las vegas on wednesday that she will not add a penny to the debt if elected president factcheck false indeed hillary clintons claim is not even close to true the committee for a responsible federal budget predicts that under clintons policies  the debt would increase by  trillion over a decade clintons plan would increase both spending and revenue the washington dcbased independent nonprofits analyst said  under our preliminary updated central estimate she would increase primary spending by  trillion over the next decade including about  billion of spending on college education  billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure and significant new healthrelated spending fact check   hillary clinton claimed that  people a yeardie from guns factcheck false this is a claim clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the american people safe however a factcheck shows clintons claim is not only false but is exaggerated by  percent she is using figures from  and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year clinton first began making this claim in november  repeated it in april  and has since repeated it again and again in april breitbart news highlighted the method clinton used to swell the numbers in  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported  firearmrelated homicides in the united states an additional  accidental firearmrelated deaths occurred in the usa figure that pales in comparison to the  deaths by accidental poisoning or the  deaths caused by falls so clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides in this way  firearmrelated deathshomicides and accidental deathsquickly become  gun violence deaths in  and an impetus for gun control fact check   hillary clinton praised president obama s economic performance adding he has cut the deficit by twothirds factcheck false this repeated democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through obama s first year in office after the  billion stimulus the massive omnibus spending bill porkulus and the deployment of the troubled asset relief program tarp which was signed by obama s predecessor but for which he voted as breitbart news noted when president obama claimed in january to have cut the deficit by almost threequarters this is pure fiction obama has doubled the national debt and its not because he cut the deficit rather he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in officewhich he assigns dishonestly to the previous fiscal year under george w bush he cut ie spent more gradually from that spending but only under protest after republicans took the house in  the truth is that obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and illconceived experiment in keynesian stimulus spending much of which was wasted on priorities that helped obama s political supporters  especially the public sector unions  but did little for the economy fact check   hillary clinton said we at the clinton foundation spend ninety percent  ninety percent  of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country factcheck false indeed clintons ninety percent claim is false according to her troubled charitys own t ax filings  peter schweizer president of the government accountability institute  breitbart news senior editoratlarge and author of clinton cash said the clinton foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors if you actually look at the numbers of their filings and s thats what it indicates schweizer said last month in an interview with siriusxm host alex marlow on breitbart news daily  the clinton foundation will say we assisted or facilitated in  kids getting immunizations well okay what does that mean and they dont really tell you they dont really explain to you how it works so the number is absolutely correct that six percent goes to other charities schweizer continued the other  percent is in this stew of marketing and management and travel expenses and sort of all these obscure things that its really hard to dissect what is the end result of that  percent being spent whats more political analyst sean davis the cofounder of the federalist and a former adviser to sen tom coburn and gov rick perry examined the clinton foundations  tax filings and found that  hillary clintons nonprofit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants the clinton foundation spent nearly  million percent of all  expenditureson travel davis contends  nearly  million percent of all expenditureswas spent on office supplies source check out over  more fact checks at breitbart so there you have it folks it was hard to narrow it down to just  but these were among the

the second presidential debate flew off the rails on sunday night when donald trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against bill clinton and suggested that hillary clinton could be in jail if hes elected in november threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server 

abcs martha raddatz one of the debate moderators asked trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking  video released friday in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission was consistent with his current behavior 
as i told you that was lockerroom talk trump said i am not proud of it i am a person who has great respect for people for my family for people of this country and im not proud of it 
trump then said if you look at the history of politics in this country no one had been so abusive of women as former president bill clinton the husband of the democratic nominee whom trump suggested intimidated those women 
three women who had previously accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with trump earlier sunday and each was seated in the front row at the debate 
mine were words  his were actions trump said 
so dont tell me about words he continued i am absolutely i apologize for those words but it is things that people say bill clinton he was impeached he was no longer allowed to practice law he had to pay an  fine to one of the women paula jones who is here tonight that when hillary brings up a point like that brings up words i say  years ago i think its disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth 
donald trump if i win im going to instruct my attorney general to investigate clinton httpstcorapuickl httpstcoiwgvuleetr 
 cnn politics cnnpolitics october  the former secretary of state responded by saying that so much of what he just said is not right but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign 
i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all she said when they go low you go high 
and look if this were just about one video maybe what hes saying tonight would be understandable she said but everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women but he never apologizes to anyone for anything 
she mentioned that trump had not apologized to the khans a couple who lost a son a muslim us soldier during the iraq war trump engaged in a lengthy backandforth with the khans after they appeared at the democratic national convention in july 
clinton also said trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera a federal judge who trump said couldnt do his job fairly because he was of mexican descent and president barack obama whose birthplace trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign 
he owes the president an apology he needs to apologize to our country and he needs to take responsibility she said 
trump responded by repeating the false claim that the clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on obamas birthplace in  he added that she owed an apology for the  emails you deleted 
if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation trump said because there have never been so many lies so much deception and were going to have a special prosecutor 
clinton said everything trump said was absolutely false but she was not surprised 
oh really trump interjected 
clinton then mentioned the difficulty in factchecking trump to which he capped off the exchange by saying youd be in jail during his potential administration",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14775855554200.jpg,conspiracy,0.0,trump hillary clinton may corrupt person ever run president,email second presidential debate flew rails sunday night donald trump invoked accusations sexual misconduct bill clinton suggested hillary clinton could jail hes elected november threatening appoint special prosecutor look private email server abcs martha raddatz one debate moderators asked trump whether behavior exposed shocking video released friday bragged groping kissing women without permission consistent current behavior told lockerroom talk trump said proud person great respect people family people country im proud trump said look history politics country one abusive women former president bill clinton husband democratic nominee trump suggested intimidated women three women previously accused bill clinton sexual misconduct held press conference trump earlier sunday seated front row debate mine words actions trump said dont tell words continued absolutely apologize words things people say bill clinton impeached longer allowed practice law pay fine one women paula jones tonight hillary brings point like brings words say years ago think disgraceful think ashamed want know truth donald trump win im going instruct attorney general investigate clinton httpstcorapuickl httpstcoiwgvuleetr cnn politics cnnpolitics october former secretary state responded saying much said right floundering campaign reminded friend michelle obama advised us said go low go high look one video maybe hes saying tonight would understandable said everyone come conclusions whether man video man stage respects women never apologizes anyone anything mentioned trump apologized khans couple lost son muslim us soldier iraq war trump engaged lengthy backandforth khans appeared democratic national convention july clinton also said trump apologized reporter whose disability mocked front camera federal judge trump said couldnt job fairly mexican descent president barack obama whose birthplace trump tried discredit multiyear campaign owes president apology needs apologize country needs take responsibility said trump responded repeating false claim clinton campaign started rumors casting doubt obamas birthplace added owed apology emails deleted win going instruct attorney general get special prosecutor look situation trump said never many lies much deception going special prosecutor clinton said everything trump said absolutely false surprised oh really trump interjected clinton mentioned difficulty factchecking trump capped exchange saying youd jail potential administration,1.0

Infowars.com,2016-10-28T05:09:26.974+03:00,shocking michele obama  hillary caught glamorizing date rape promoters,"most top retailers sell food produced with beekilling pesticides only aldi costco and whole foods got passing grades julie fidler  infowarscom  october   comments 
a new scorecard report gives a failing grade to  out of  major food retailers in the united states based on their policies and practices regarding pollinator protection organic options and pesticide reduction  source friends of the earth 
tiffany finckhaynes food futures campaigner with friends of the earth said 
us food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis 
the majority of the food sold at top us food retailers is produced with pollinatortoxic pesticides we urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinatortoxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators people and the planet  organic offerings and transparency are lacking 
the report swarming the aisles rating top retailers on beefriendly and organic food is the work of a coalition led by friends of the earth and more than  farmer beekeeper farmworker environmental and public interest organizations  
the coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators  and increase us department of agriculture usda certified organic food and beverages to  of overall offerings by  the group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic regional and local producers 
friends of the earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than  garden retailers including lowes and home depot to commit to eliminate pollinatortoxic neonicotinoid neonic pesticides 
according to haynes the demand for organic foods has grown by doubledigits  but grocers arent keeping up she said 
a lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future  
as evidenced by the groups research its difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food eleven of the  retailers websites examined by friends of the earth dont provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food pollinators andor pesticides  haynes said adding 
theres a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings and then be able to sell that in their stores americans are ready for change 
a yougov poll released  october  by friends of the earth and sumofus reveals that  of americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture  and  of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids  
additionally the poll shows that  of respondents believe its important for supermarkets to sell organic food another  said theyd likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent 
said angus wong lead campaign strategist at sumofus a consumer watchdog with ten million members 
over  sumofus members have spoken out advocating that us hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators and after years of pressure home depot and lowes have finally enacted more beefriendly policies 
and the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too this is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately 
only four of the nations top food retailers  albertsons costco target and whole foods  have adopted and made public a companywide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food  they are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer or organic sales 
aldi food lion part of the delhaize group and kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales 
none of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from american farmers  retailer apathy is killing pollinators 
of the top  food retailers surveyed by friends of the earth a shocking  were predominantly unresponsive to friends of the earths requests for information via surveys calls and letters the group was forced to turn to publicly available information including company websites company annual reports us securities and exchange commission filings corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports press coverage and industry analyses for their data 
we have bees to thank for every  in  bites of food we take  and without bees stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds source bee cause 
science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline glyphosate the main ingredient in monsantos blockbuster herbicide roundup has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines  
several us cities have banned neonics including boulder city colorado  and portland oregon  this past spring maryland became the first state to ban the pesticides

Sean Colarossi,2016-10-28T02:50:17.547+03:00,trump proposes canceling election calls black communities ghettos at ohio rally,"here is the full text of sen reids letter to director comey dear director comey 
your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election through your partisan actions you may have broken the law 
the double standard established by your actions is clear 
in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump his top advisors and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states which trump praises at every opportunity the public has a right to know this information i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public there is no danger to american interests from releasing it and yet you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information 
by contrast as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible 
moreover in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election despite the fact that for all you know the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton 
as you know a memo authored by deputy attorney general sally yates on march   makes clear that all justice department employees including you are subject to the hatch act the memo defines the political activity prohibited under the hatch act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group 
the clear doublestandard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information along with your timing was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group 
please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-04T02:09:39.970+02:00,nigerian novelist wonders why everyone loves hillary,"obamas weighs options for his final stab at israel in his twilight months in office obama seeks to undermine americas closest ally november   ari lieberman 
israelis and the proisrael community at large will breathe a collective sigh of relief when obama leaves office during obamas tenure relations with israel were caustic at best barely five months after taking office he publicly launched a scathing attack against israel  where he perversely insinuated a moral equivalence between israeli and palestinian actions  and did so in one of the most virulently antisemitic countries on the planet he later skipped over israel despite the fact that israel was a mere minute plane ride away that was obamas opening salvo against americas closest ally it was only downhill from there 
obama utilized highlevel administration sources to leak negative information about israel to sympathetic members of the press in one such instance an administration official probably ben rhodes  referred to prime minister benjamin netanyahu as a  chickensht  in another instance obama voiced concurrence with french president nicholas sarkozy when sarkozy characterized netanyahu as a  liar  
often the obama administration would subject israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits israels defense minister moshe yaalon was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata in the most notorious incident obama left netanyahu out in the cold while having dinner with michelle and his daughters one commentator dryly noted that obama treated netanyahu as though he was the president of equatorial guinea 
ultimately obama crossed the line and received significant pushback from democratic lawmakers and donors obama got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deepseeded animus against israel never dissipated and relations with israels prime minister remained toxic 
tensions surfaced again during israels counter insurgency campaign against the gazabased terror group hamas obama held up a shipment of hellfire missiles to israel and then tried to strongarm israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by turkey and qatar two despotic nations that support hamas and gave aid and comfort to islamic state terrorists 
obama saw netanyahus opposition to the jcpoa the socalled iran deal as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations the socalled settlements were another point of contention obama disregarded a letter of assurance to israel provided by the bush administration specifying that in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of  
bush gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of israel to build within those blocs it is also important to note that no new settlement was created during obamas term of office and netanyahu had even agreed to an unprecedented month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories but nothing was ever enough for obama who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate israel at every turn his parting shot was at the united nations general assembly during a recent address to that contemptible body he explicitly singled out israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of indonesia obamas moral compass had gone completely awry 
despite the fact that obama is in his twilight months he can still inflict immeasurable harm on israel according to a report featured in the wall street journal  obama is contemplating several options each with significant negative implications for israel the report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after november  so as not to harm clintons presidential prospects 
he may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of israeli communities living in east jerusalem judea and samaria perhaps more ominously he may seek to impose dictates on israel utilizing the un security council 
in one such scenario obama may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring israeli communities situated in judea and samaria to be illegal alternatively the administration may seek formal recognition of the state of palestine even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects israels existence as a jewish state lastly he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant israeli territorial concessions 
the united states does not have to actively support any unsc resolution to see the successful passage of antiisraeli measures it merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers france facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized muslim population has historically been the fiercest advocate for the palestinian arabs it is likely that the administration would seek to have the french submit a draft resolution and the united states would simply abstain while the permanent and nonpermanent members voted thus guaranteeing passage 
israel has few friends on the security council and american collusion with a body that could arguably be considered todays greatest purveyors of antisemitism would be an act of extreme betrayal it would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement 
but israel is not without recourse there is strong bipartisan support for israel in congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the white house their strong opposition to un involvement 
some like the jerusalem posts caroline glick have suggested that the israelis can reach out to the russians with carrots in an effort to counter obamas nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch moscow has always been in the pockets of the muslim bloc and its recent vote at unesco in support of a resolution denying the jewish nexus to jerusalem serves to reinforce this view moreover even if russia can be persuaded relying on putin for favors is akin to borrowing money from the mafia and would come with a steep price 
it is ironic that with the multitude of problems currently facing the administration  spiraling healthcare costs racial discord cyber breaches russias seizure of crimea and eastern ukraine isis the meltdown in the arab world iranian terrorism chinas expansion into the south and east china seas the migrant crisis immigration reform  obama would choose to focus his negative energies on harming the mideasts only democracy and americas staunchest ally that fact in it of itself speaks volumes about the man",english,frontpagemag.com,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg,hate,1.0,european media jihad geert wilders,time magazines joe klein wrong hillary clinton rebutting absurd claims namesake november joseph klein time magazines joe klein penned article entitled hillary clinton choice keep america great feel duty bound respond least absurd comments made namesake author primary colors novel based bill clintons first presidential campaign joe klein laments hillary severely damaged course year battering shes received hands extremists media sorry hillarys wounds selfinflicted lies greed corruption go back decades reached crescendo dual scandals use private server state department business secretary state payforplay clinton foundation one part trump indisputably real ego joe klein wrote hillary epitome humility grace would put clintons failings league trumps depravities delusional declared klein agree statement precisely opposite reason advances trump abuse public office personal gain hand pick hillarys word ambassador serve one dangerous countries world never respond multiple requests enhanced security let alone pick phone contact ambassador chris stevens directly government able save four lives keep four lives safe keep country safe asked stevens former fiancé rhetorical question hillary would unable answer trump lie families slain benghazi hillary trump put national security risk using private server government emails order evade freedom information act hillary short anyone thinks hillarys proven record recklessness mendacity indifference troubling several orders magnitude trumps depravities delusional joe klein complains trump deals stereotypes blacks hispanics muslims women yes even veterans yet much hillarys pitch genderbased elect woman attacks millions people support opponent vile epithets deplorable racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic good measure irredeemable joe klein charges trump gone wrong society nothing gone right paraphrase bill clinton would depend definitions wrong right hillary clinton really right parrots black lives matters stereotypical attacks characterized white privilege systemic racism country right leaps conclusions police brutality aimed africanamericans evidence specific cases carefully examined dont think hillary also represents political correctness antireligious bigotry secular left elite many americans believe truly gone wrong society women world summit last year example hillary said order fully secure reproductive rights women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs structural biases changed hillary demeaned sincerely held religious belief sanctity life held millions americans reminiscent president obamas contemptuous clinging religion quote back hillarys key supporters top aides targeted catholic church particular notion progressive reform needs catholic spring catholics demand end middle ages dictatorship beginning little democracy respect gender equality catholic church wrote sandy newman president voices progress email clintons campaign chairman john podesta response podesta picked spring theme wrote created catholics alliance common good organize moment like think lacks leadership likewise catholics united like spring movements think one bottom time magazines joe klein talks right wrong american society get washington dc bubble often actually speak american people daytoday concerns even hillary clinton ends winning election country remain divided mandate whatsoever advance progressive agenda,1.0

admin,2016-10-27T13:58:44.202+03:00,get ready for civil unrest survey finds that most americans are concerned about election violence,"record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban 
steve   
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

samar pahwa,2016-10-27T22:38:00.000+03:00,top  pet care tips,"keywords election   rigged election  voting  voting errors  voting machines malfunction voting machines malfunction 
this is just a straight up fact especially since many of our voting machines are so antiquated as you vote this year you should watch out for these glitches sometimes the votes appear to be flipped as in a voter intends to vote for candidate a but candidate bs name is selected on the screen 
when this happens it is known as vote flipping and is supposed to only happen rarely with millions of votes cast there have supposedly only been a few hundred reports of vote flipping every year for the past decade these are the ones reported so you do wonder whether this happens unnoticed much more often im just saying im seeing reports of this specifically happening all around the country so cast your vote and double check check your ballot after you cast your vote and if it happens to you call on a poll worker to help get it fixed remember voting machine malfunctions do happen 
there are reports of this happening already in north carolina texas and nevada with machines vote flipping in the last couple weeks 
you have to remember that the majority of the machines in use today predate the iphone or the ipad and most of them use technology from the late s lawrence norden a voting technology expert at the brennan center for justice in new york told time as these machines age you start to have hardware issues 
one problem that also occurs on older machines is the glue that attaches the screen to the machine breaks down and you can get alignment issues as well poll workers and technicians need to reset the machines regularly to ensure the buttons are lined up right in other cases it can just be a user error because no one uses the type of equipment used at the voting centers on a regular basis 
in texas voters reported attempting to vote a straight republican ticket but found the clintonkaine ticket selected instead this can be found specifically in voting districts where they use the old rotarystyle voting machine 
if you select one candidate and the other appears on the screen or if youre looking at the summary screen and it just isnt right voters should notify the poll workers they can cancel out your session so you can do it over poll from presstvcom ",english,naturalnews.com,http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Woman-Floss-Teeth-Close-up.jpg,junksci,0.0,instagram becomes backbone businesses,taking care eye health natural way ad hbs account httpblogsnaturalnewscomtakingcareeyehealthnaturalway jade rich posted monday october pm edt keywords best foods eye health betacarotene cataracts eye health foods contain antioxidants free radicals lutein macular degeneration maintaining healthy eyes mesozeaxanthin natural vision training naturally occurring antioxidants ocular migraines optic nerve damage protect eyes vitamin c vitamin e zeaxanthin people think eye health first thing comes mind whether need wear glasses although vision major part overall eye health actually many things need concerned example staggering common disorders plague eyes issues range cataracts ocular migraines fortunately many natural methods utilize help keep eyes healthy nutrients eyes need three nutrients known critical maintaining healthy eyes lutein zeaxanthin mesozeaxanthin nutrients serves antioxidant helps protect eyes damaging effects free radicals natural news pointed free radicals main basis injuries illnesses deaths antioxidants way fight free radicals good thing three nutrients found naturally human eye happens something interrupts process sadly end long list eye health problems may even lead blindness instead merely sitting back allowing happen proactive start taking supplements good news lutein zeaxanthin supplements easy find research discovered supplements also contain mesozeaxanthin although isnt usually disclosed label fact sounds likely recently discovered eye nutrient natural byproduct lutein zeaxanthin course doesnt absolve supplement companies duty report whether mesozeaxanthin present products however negligence also doesnt reduce natural reliance eyes three nutrients addition stocking supplements also wise increase intake naturally occurring antioxidants including vitamin e vitamin c beta carotene food sources many foods contain antioxidants carrots perhaps wellknown resource eye health rich beta carotene would mistake think carrots prime resource though also turn oranges tomatoes sweet potatoes dark berries mixture necessary vitamins best foods eye health even better derive lutein zeaxanthin directly food sources eggs pistachios corn peppers kale enough food items diet avoid cost supplements still keeping eyes extremely healthy additional eye health tips smoker also concerned eye health good time carefully consider quitting unfortunately people smoke increased risk developing macular degeneration optic nerve damage cataracts begin abstaining tobacco products though odds ending one eye health complications begin decline easy steps take protect eyes include always wearing sunglasses sunny days steering clear computer screens much possible use computer work take second vision break every minutes ultimately combining proper nutrients easy tips wearing sunglasses help keep eyes healthy throughout life youre currently dealing issues light sensitivity vision loss may also able naturally regain control eye health using natural vision training eye exercises definitely better option undergoing surgery extensive list serious risks usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses usual natural way better author jade rich lpn director inpatient rehabilitation center mother three children always looking natural ways keep kids eyes healthy knows experience another way scheduling routine eye exams helps early detection prevention best schedule backtoschool season visit pediatrician examines eye alignment gives test visual acuity sources,1.0
No Author,2016-11-05T01:09:27.343+02:00,life how do you stack up here is the recruitment puzzle general mills uses to hire new talent,"email 
over the past year a few highprofile court cases involving rape have spurred an intense national discussion on the topic whether it was brock turner a stanford swimmer who was sentenced to six months in a county jail for his rape of an unconscious woman or owen labrie a student at an elite prep school who raped a yearold classmate but was arraigned on lesser charges our justice system has tried to convict rapists with varying degrees of success as a father i look at these cases and i cant help but worry for my children in times like these we must take a stand and we must teach our sons that being brought to trial and then convicted of rape is simply utterly wrong 
our children and more specifically our boys need to know that they should never under any circumstances be put in a situation where they could potentially lose a case accusing them of sexual assault my son knows that and every parent should make an effort to teach their boys the same 
whether they made the vile unforgivable mistake of having a bad lawyer calling an unreliable witness or openly admitting to their crime to an undecided jury americas youth must understand that being convicted of rape should never ever happen going to court for sexual assault is one thing but being declared guilty is quite another and as responsible parents we need to do everything in our power to ensure that no child crosses that line no questions asked 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever 
i dont care who you areif you have a son you need to teach him that being convicted of rape even just one time is unforgivable the truth is the moment your boy loses a rape trial is the moment that lives are ruined and theres absolutely no taking that back 
as a father of a young man myself i would not be able to live with myself if he someday went to jail just because of something as easily preventable as a sexual assault conviction when i look into my yearold callums eyes the last thing i want to think about is my little guy becoming the type of man who cant somehow weasel his way out of a highprofile court case in front of all his friends family and the public at large 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever because if we want this generation of boys to grow into men that we truly take pride in we have to start teaching them that any young man who gets punished for rape brings shame not only to himself but also to his gender and this country as a whole

admin,2016-10-27T17:25:33.295+03:00,video rude cnn reporter asks trump why hes taking time off to open a hotel,"ive been living in south east asia for almost a decade now and over that time ive come to have a matured perspective on living here and a fair appreciation of the pros and cons of doing so like most people who come here i set off thinking i was going to live in paradise thats far from the reality let me tell you
living in south east asia has its pros and cons just like anywhere else while i myself have decided to return west for a while ill always have a connection to asia and im sure ill be back many times throughout my life
so whats the real story with living in asia is it all its cracked up to be what does a man have to be aware of when coming here lets look at six common stereotypical ideas about living in south east asia and assess them in the light of reality
 asian women are kind gentle and compliant to their husbands so sweet not so fast
this is most definitely a myth and if you come out here expecting to find some little house pet who does your bidding youll be in for a rude awakening
its definitely true that asian women in my experience are a lot more traditional they give the man his place in the house rarely question your final decisions and do not resent housework and basic wifely duties
however the idea that theyll just do whatever you tell them without question is nonsense theyre human beings with a will of their own and you wouldnt be the first guy to get a smack in the head from a fivefoottwo broad who weighs  pounds if you disrespect her
the idea that asian women are some sort of angelic alternative to western women is also nonsense while its not the norm ive met several western men who have been taken to the cleaners by their asian wives and girlfriends when you move here youre completely at her mercy and you will never have any legal rights as a citizen
asian women generally are a lot more traditional but this stereotype that theyre some sort of perfect wife material has got to go theyre individualsand there are all kinds good and bad among them
read this guide to dating asian women for a more complete perspective on the issue its a thorny subject and theres a lot of misunderstanding surrounding it
 asia is ridiculously cheap 
this is one id have to lean slightly towards agreeing with
most things in asia are a lot cheaper eating out for my entire family often costs less than  meaning i can afford to do it basically every day my rent for a condo apartment costs less than  a month although thats mostly because i live in the sticks and am not in a major city
a general rule of thumb is that outside of major cities like bangkok singapore and kl you can divide the cost of living by three and get a rough estimate
note this does not apply to consumer goods such as cars and electrical appliances which are in and around the same price it certainly does not apply to luxury goods which are often much more expensive because of the taxes placed on them by local governments
asia is cheaper overall but anything other than the basics costs roughly the same life in south east asia can be cheaper but it isnt necessarily soit depends on your lifestyle
 you can become a citizen of an asian country and stay forever becoming a citizen in an asian country is nigh on impossible even if you could you probably wouldnt want to
you can get a variety of visas like permanent residency and each country aims to facilitate the spouses of their nationals and especially retirees with proven cash in the bank however youll not become a citizen with all of the various rights they enjoy
its also worth noting while you might get permanent residence youll never be one of them even if you live here for  years you will always be a foreigner and will be viewed as such by locals this has pros and cons to it but youll never quite feel at home and accepted as one of the group
youll get undue respect from some for being a westerner but forget about talking politics or leveling criticisms at the way things are doneyoull be met with hostility and resentment for the latter
 the weather in asia is  sunshine 
the weather in south east asia is generally pretty awesome and you can live an outdoors life youll truly enjoy if youre that type
the sun shines almost every day and even when its overcast its warm meaning you can go out and about and do anything from walk on the beach to shop in the city
however when the storms come youd better be prepared to get your ass inside the rainfall and wind in many countries in south east asia is truly terrifying just switch on any news station the next time a major storm hits the philippines and youll see what its like
thankfully after  years of living in the philippines  ive never been caught directly in a major storm although ive seen the tail end of plenty of them
the weather is good when its good and utterly awful when its bad check this clip out to see how bad it can get

 asia is  years behind the west in terms of development 
this is a stereotype thats deeply mistaken and whether or not its true depends on which country you go to
true countries like laos and bangladesh are miles behind any western nation but head to singapore and youll be shocked by how far ahead of us they are in terms of tech and development
asia is developing at breakneck pace and with that development comes super highways skytrains skyscrapers and everything else we usually associate with an advanced country it wont be long before many countries out here catch up and surpass the west although it is definitely true that most of them are slightly behind for now
theres a phenomenon called leapfrogging which virtually guarantees asian countries will catch up to and surpass the west quickly leapfrogging is when they can skip all of the evolution and development and simply emulate modern day technology developed elsewherea great example is india where they have skipped the transition from dialup to mobie internet and gone straight from nothing to mobile
if you think this cant be done and there are intellectual property laws to protect tech from being stolen wholesale i salute you but i have to laugh there are no such laws and even if there were nobody would bother to enforce them
on the other hand you still have many scenes like this outside your window when you get out of the main cities

 asians are extremely family oriented again this is one i lean towards agreeing with there are exceptions to every rule but the family unit is extremely strong in asia especially countries like the philippines
i dont want to wax lyrical or speculate as to why this is its enough to acknowledge it as a fact and accept that its the case  of the asian people i have ever met and gotten to know from indonesia to the philippines to thailand are devoted to their families to the extent that wed consider it cultlike in most western countries
i pass no judgment on this whatsoever it can be a great thing or a bad thing depending on your own perspective i personally like it and think its something weve lost in many european countries and america too
this is an idea about asia i agree withthe dedication to family above individuality is definitely true and so by default if you get into a relationship with an asian woman be prepared for this
the family unit is the sun around which everything orbits in most asian countries
living in asia summary sorry to disappoint you fellas but you wont find paradise in south east asia
what you will find is a place with many opportunities pitfalls pros and cons but which i do not regret living in for a single second and which has come to be a large part of my lifes story
i came out for a year and stayed for almost a decade however ive decided that time is now over and its time to go home
id love to hear about your experiences living or traveling in asia do you find my perceptions to be accurate or do you have a different view

north koreas foreign ministry slammed the shamelessness of israel on friday calling the jewish state a rogue group that poses a nuclear threat and commits terrorist attacks against neighboring countries on friday the korean central news agency released a statement attributed to north koreas foreign ministry that responded to comments israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu made last week that were critical of the hermit kingdom this is an unpardonable insult and provocation to the dignity and social system in the dprk and the choice made by its people the statement said of netanyahus comments referring to north korea by its official name the democratic peoples republic of korea the statement then took issue with israels foreign policy in the middle east stating israel not only represents dictatorial forces for aggression that trample down the legitimate right of the palestinian people and indiscriminately kill them but also is a rogue group that poses a nuclear threat and makes terrorist attacks on its neighboring countries with lots of nuclear weapons the statement was responding to comments netanyahu made during a press conference with japanese prime minister shinzo abe last week in which the israeli leader repeatedly drew parallels between iran and north korea and prime minister abe we have something else in common netanyahu began we are two peace loving democracies that face formidable threats from nearby rogue states both iran and north korea are governed by ruthless and extreme dictatorships states that seek to bully and intimidate their neighbors and in our case to actually eradicate us from the face of the earth noting that iran and north korea have aggressive military nuclear programs netanyahu repeated his plea to not allow iran to use diplomacy to advance its nuclear program as he alleges north korea did with the  agreed framework iran cannot be allowed to travel the road taken by north korea its not the first time that north korea has slammed israel or even netanyahu publicly after netanyahu criticized pyongyang during a trip to japan last year the north korean foreign ministry released a similar statement which called israel a cancer to peace in the middle east it also accused netanyahu of trying to use north korea to divert international criticism of israel caused by its settlement activity and breakdown in the middle east peace talks similarly in last weeks statement north koreas foreign ministry said everybody knows about the shamelessness of israel telling lies and making fabrications and pointing accusing fingers to others to justify its criminal acts and evade the censure and condemnation by the international community besides trading public insults israel has long been concerned about north koreas support for arab states that are hostile to israel as well as iran in fact during the  yom kippur war north korea actually deployed a squadron of migs to egypt which engaged in a firefight with israeli fs neither side sustained any damage more recently north korea has been accused of proliferating ballistic missiles and nuclear technology to syria and iran in  israel destroyed syrias al kibar nuclear reactor

"David Gutierrez, staff writer",2016-10-30T13:00:00.000+02:00,why hydrogen peroxide should be in every home,"doctors prescribe deadly opioid for painrelated issues that arent even legal share in big pharma  fda  harmful medicine  health  medical marijuana  pharmaceutical drug addiction 
corruption bribery death all three are examined in various news reports on a little known specialty pharmaceutical company called insys theraputics they are currently under legal fire for subsys a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl a very fast acting opioid that is  times more potent than morphine the under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream the federal drug administration fda has ruled that subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from sudden spikes of excruciating pain 
sarah fuller was a  year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia  she didnt have cancer but that didnt stop her doctor from prescribing subsys for her aches and pains the fentanyl acted quickly with sarahs already prescribed xanax a benzodiazepine she died her family is suing the manufacturer but why did sarahs doctor prescribe a drug that wasnt approved thats easy to answer just follow the money 
as stat reports the sales of subsys grew to  million precisely because physicians give it to patients that dont have cancer like sarah fuller doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner or lunch over  million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity 
take the example of nurse practitioner heather alfonso from illinois she was paid  to go to dinner with a few people and in response prescribed  million dollars of subsys scripts to patients that werent suffering with cancer pain she didnt contest the allegations against her 
getting paid to speak isnt automatically a bribe but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to susbys marketing methods alabama prosecutors built a case against nancy reed perhacs who used to be a sales representative for insys theraputics ms perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend provided he prescribed subsys her take was  other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in kansas rhode island new york oregon michigan florida and new hampshire 
the chief executive founder and chairman of insys theraputics is billionaire john kapoor hes been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups kapoor thinks doctors are all ethical his new fda approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol thc called syndros as states legalize the real medicine in cannabis  thc and cbd oil  this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott

keywords atlanta  food  food waste  fresh food  georgia  hunger  landfills  perishable food  second helpings atlanta  volunteers  waste managment 
food waste and hunger are enormous global environmental and public health problems as overwhelming as these issues are community groups volunteers local businesses and organizations are working on trying to find a solution 
what started as a social action project in  a few members of a small community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste 
and theyre succeeding 
the project grew into a nonprofit organization with a team of more than  volunteer drivers a network of more than  donors and frontline agencies who feed the hungry on a daily basis 
amazingly the entire group has rescued more than  million pounds of food  enough to provide  million meals heres more of this motivating againstallodds story food waste and hunger 
about a third of the planets food goes to waste thats enough to feed two billion people 
the united nations environment programme unep and the world resources institute wri report that about onethird of all food produced worldwide  worth around  trillion  are lost or wasted in food production and consumption systems 
furthermore the natural resources defense council nrdc cites the following 
forty percent of the food in the united states is never eaten but at the same time one in eight americans struggles to put enough food on the table 
nearly  million people worldwide suffer from hunger  but according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations we squander enough food  globally  trillion pounds a year  to feed every one of them more than twice over 
in developing nations much of the food is lost after harvest because of the lack of refrigeration good roads and adequate storage facilities on the other hand developed nations waste more food when retailers order display or serve too much 
additionally consumers waste food when they ignore leftovers in the back of their refrigerators  or toss perishable food out before it expires more alarming statistics of wasted food 
much of the wasted food in the us ends up in landfills the us environmental protection agency epa reports that food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste sent to landfills in the united states 
and it accounts for about  percent of the waste stream thats more than  million tons of food waste that the us sends to the landfills each year 
additionally according to nrdc on average people dining out leave  percent of meals uneaten and  percent of these potential leftovers are not taken home 
in spite of the dismal statistics on food waste  and the struggles and pain hungry people endure  community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers in metroatlanta georgia are making headway in not wasting food and feeding people in need people are fed perishable food not wasted 
more than ten years ago a few members of a community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste they wanted to take leftover fresh food from grocery stores and restaurants and quickly deliver it to agencies that provide food to families and individuals in need 
since the first delivery was made in  the group has rescued more than  million pounds of food and the group believes this figure equals enough to provide more than  million meals 
as success mounted in eliminating food waste and feeding people in their community the group established itself as a nonprofit organization called second helpings atlanta  now second helpings atlanta has  donors  partner agencies and a team of more than  volunteer drivers who pick up and drop off perishable food every day 
executive director joe labriola says the challenge is getting the food from those who have it to those who need it and thats what we do we play a very specific role we do  scheduled pickups and deliveries a week weve gotten pretty good at this fresh food versus nonperishable 
fresh food provides more nutrition than the nonperishable processed diet that so many people eat  especially people with low or no income one of second helpings atlantas goals is to change that standard offering fresh food that will ideally help prompt healthier eating habits 
this year the group has delivered  pounds of food and labriola estimates they will pick up and deliver more than  million pounds by the end of the year 
the reason were so focused on perishable food is that were providing nutrition to the diets of people who are surviving on processed food were breaking the cycle and hope that some of the health benefits of fresh food will start to kick in 
according to labriola he sees no reason why this type of food waste program cant easily be adopted anywhere he adds that  percent of the food produced in the us is never consumed and the average annual cost per household of food that is thrown out is  
twenty percent of people in georgia live in a foodinsecure environment  meaning theyre not sure when theyre going to eat next its a pretty grim story labriola says but if we rescue just  percent of that food we can feed  million americans how its working 
when people sign up to volunteer theyre shown the available routes then theyre asked to choose the route that would work best with their location and schedule 
most pickups are regularly scheduled however the group often gets calls from people holding weddings bar mitzvahs or festivals  knowing there will be leftover food at the end of the night then a call goes out to find a volunteer to help pickup and delivery the leftover food 
volunteer drivers make food deliveries every day of the year except christmas food pickups range in size  so people can pick them up no matter if they own a small sedan or a minivan that way volunteering is within the reach of everyone 
from the time a driver leaves home  stopping to pick up the food and drop it off at a partner agency  it usually takes no longer than  minutes for he or she to return home families volunteer 
quite often entire families will volunteer and work together for the weekly delivery service labriola says families volunteering are instrumental to educating younger generations about hunger and food waste 
for example around thanksgiving a family with two young children met labriola one day to pick up dozens of turkeys at a grocery store the children looked amazed as they helped carry the delivery  birdbybird  from the store to the truck and into the agency that would distribute them to families labriola told the kids they just helped feed  families the children soon realized what they did one of the children said thats as many kids that are in my school 
the exemplary work and dedication exhibited by volunteers in the metroatlanta georgia community is a truly successful model of how to eliminate food waste and hunger perhaps more community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers will consider following their worthy example you might also like",english,legorafi.fr,No Image URL,satire,0.0,après le succès de mariés au premier regard va lancer fécondées au premier regard le gorafi,keywords food packaging packaging one major reasons lots people choose organic foods avoid exposure chemicals however organic foods beans often come packaging done well lots chemicals present greatly interfere normal physiology especially wrong choice packaging company various types food packaging possibly leach compounds food investigate packaging kitchen youll observe lot materials concerned regardless possibility youre part real food type individual presumably canned merchandise oats pastas granola bars packaged plastic bags plastic wrap plastic storage washroom far food refreshment cans seem accounts made metals like steel aluminum reality lined bpa bps deplorable substitutes like polyvinyl chloride pvc contains known cancercausing agent vinyl chloride canned soup soda significantly seltzer juices likely exposing bpa different compounds youre ideal situation ingesting even packaging made evidently amiable paper might lined chemicals concern like pfass found pizza boxes wrapping slick takeout food extra chemicals flame retardants bpa worked way paper packaging laudable efforts recycle paper presented variety different contaminants environmental working group ewg added yet another database arsenal chemical data consumers permitting individuals need avoid exposure toxins check bpa food packaging built database since contend consumers right recognize whats food particularly regards ingredient example bpa linked cancer infertility mind nervous system cardiovascular abnormalities diabetes obesity different genuine disorders theres simple route average consumer discover food stuffed little research demonstrating amount chemicals migrate food wholefood unpackaged eating regimen best safeguard chemicals packaging also important check reputation packaging company positively negatively rated since large number unknowns regards packaging solid option avoid conceivable proper packaging go long way ensuring retain health body one key things making packaging safe entrusting packaging company knows importance eliminating chemicals food stuffs packaging companies careful dealing food packaging foods wrongly without proper care pose risk health ruin name packaging company ways drastically reduce harm may arise food packaging point conceivable avoid canned foods beverages plastic wrap plastic bottles instead pick glass cook beans must buy look reputable packaging companies accomplish greater amount food preservation lessen exposure packaging chemicals go dehydrating gardens harvest storing glass containers avoid putting hot food plastic storage containers heating foods packaged plastic microwave plastics significantly inclined leach chemicals heated experts recommend keeping plastics dishwasher following measures go long way ensuring consume chemicals risky health author bio karen cole freelance writer health beauty niche currently research food packaging wwwallinpackagingcouk helping lot completing research hope like post might also like,0.0

question relating to quantum computing since qubits are what makes up quantum computers that being a qubits can act like a transistor that can be either on off or both on and off at the same time in usual computing transistors are either on or off in quantum they can be both on and off at the same time the question i have is simply this is it possible to make a transistor that can act as on off and on and off at the same time even if you had to add an extra layer of circuitry to get that same reading from that single transistor i mean a normal transistor operate that if it gets no voltage or low voltage then the transistor is in an off state if it gets a certain voltage it is in an on state couldnt you make the voltage extra high to get a both onoff at the same time state or half voltage to get the same onoff state at the same time to essentially create a fake qubit scenario there might have to be additional transistors to help make sure of that determination of a transistor appearing in an onoff state but couldnt it be possible perhaps a circuit of transistors could determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as both onoff by checking the voltage some how idk please answer me like im a drunk stupid idiot perhaps laymen terms i can be quite the idiot sometimes thanks for hearing me out im currently drunk and just pondering things link a reply to darage im sure we could do weird stuff with circuitry to store more than one bit of data in the circuit but that doesnt really give an advantage over just storing more bits with our conventional technology which has been highly refined the advantage of the qbit isnt really that it stores more information its that it can be used to process more information at the same time quantum  computing  quantum computing the key features of an ordinary computerbits registers logic gates algorithms and so onhave analogous features in a quantum computer instead of bits a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits which work in a particularly intriguing way where a bit can store either a zero or a  a qubit can store a zero a one both zero and one or an infinite number of values in betweenand be in multiple states store multiple values at the same time if that sounds confusing think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time schrödingers cat being alive and dead or a car being a bicycle and a bus a gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals if you blow on something like a flute the pipe fills up with a standing wave a wave made up of a fundamental frequency the basic note youre playing and lots of overtones or harmonics higherfrequency multiples of the fundamental the wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously theyre added together to make a combined wave that includes them all qubits use superposition to represent multiple states multiple numeric values simultaneously in a similar way just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once so it can process them simultaneously instead of working in serial doing a series of things one at a time in a sequence it can work in parallel doing multiple things at the same time only when you try to find out what state its actually in at any given moment by measuring it in other words does it collapse into one of its possible statesand that gives you the answer to your problem estimates suggest a quantum computers ability to work in parallel would make it millions of

trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isnt hard getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that trump is the liar of liars is same thing with bullying but the new york times put together a spread of all the bullyish things trump has said and tweeted and to whom now the toronto star s daniel dale has been tracking trumps lies for just six weeks and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies which you can find here  
there are literally hundreds of lies in trumps speeches theyre not all  unique but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that trump will say anything to smear anyone including his enemies while keeping his supporters happy 
is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much tons of people claim hillary is a master liar but first shes actually more honest than most politicians second even if she could be considered anything like a master liar she still could not compete with trump the liar in any way shape or form 
the star put the lies into a whopping  categories clintons policies wtf daeshmiddle east clintons record african americansinner cities the clintons corruption rigged election tradeeconomy health care trumps endorsements refugeesimmigration polls obamas record the campaign russia trumps record taxes sex assault allegations clintons health and government corruption 
they also compiled a list of the top  types of lies trump has told and gave more detailed analysis beginning with the electoral system is rigged of course its rigged against him 
after plummeting in the polls after the first two debates trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election rigged became his catchword 
he claimed hillary clinton campaign workers hired thugs to cause violence at his rallies twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage clinton he claimed there was widespread voter fraud in philadelphia chicago and st louis  cities with large black populations that heavily favour democrats 
in greeley colo trump told his supporters if they dont trust mailin ballots they should vote again in person so one did trump supporter terri lynn rote a yearold from iowa was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice 
nobodys committing voter suppression and fraud quite like trumpsters and republicans 
another is muslims are risky this touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from syria who could be the great trojan horse of our time 
his claims that syrian refugees   per cent are muslim  are terrorists plays to the fears of the other even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children and their numbers is nowhere near trumps claims  about  have been admitted to the united states in  
the polls favour trump har de har har  trump only looks at the polls he likes and theyre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls very few of the established scientific polls favor him nevertheless 
it seems clear trump manipulates exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is this poll denialism gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data suggests cnn 
his false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling  and perhaps even the vote itself if supporters feel trump should be doing better then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible 
on oct  he said i won the last two debates and every poll showed it in fact every scientific poll showed that he lost 
of course when unscientific online polls came out in his favour trump was quick to promote  and exaggerate  those numbers 
but these are just a few of his biggest most repeated lies he has also falsely said on twitter the failing nytimes reporters dont even call us anymore they just write whatever they want to write making up sources along the way falsely said by open borders hillary means totally unlimited immigration falsely said hillarys plan includes an open border with the middle east falsely called nbc anchor lester holt the moderator of the first debate a democrat falsely said wow just came out on secret tape that crooked hillary wants to take in as many syrians as possible falsely said the us provided iran  billion as part of the nuclear deal falsely said in san bernardino many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed  and wounded many many peoplemuslims have to report the problems when they see them falsely asserted that clinton has been fighting isis her entire adult life falsely said all together the hillary clinton plan would bring in  refugees in her first term falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring nato obsolete because it doesnt cover terror falsely suggested nato created an antiterror position because of his comments falsely claimed clinton didnt release cholesterol or ekg information falsely said sexual assault allegations against him have been largely debunked falsely said apparently of sexual assault accuser summer zervos the one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense falsely said i did not i did not to clintons charge that he thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese falsely said i was against going into iraq and its so welldocumented falsely said our taxes are so high just about the highest in the world 
and so many more just in the last six weeks yes many of them are repeats but lies are lies if trump sees this hell likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the papers lying and continue to sell the myth that hes not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies

Gillian,2016-11-06T21:00:47.705+02:00,the chronovisor a device used to look into the future and past,"cyrus mistry joins aap tata sons shortlists candidates for chairmans post posted on tweet image via intodayin 
ousted chairman of tata sons cyrus mistry today joined the aam aadmi party speaking to the media cyrus mistry said the media government regulators or politicians no one is supporting me in fighting against the injustice i have faced kejriwalji is my only hope so i joined the aap 
speaking at the occasion aap supremo and delhi cm arvind kejriwal said having worked at tata steel several years ago i have firsthand experience of how the board of directors of tata sons did not allow me to work that is the reason i quit tata steel 
just like cyrus mistry i also took up the top job in delhi because there were no other suitable candidate i empathize with cyrus mistry when he says that ratan tata did not allow him to do work in a similar way narendra modi and najeeb jung do not allow me to do work in delhi he added 
why should someone be fired for choosing to close loss making uk steel business first take care of indians before subsidizing british citizens ratan tata is a british agent even aap does not fire its leaders so fast he declared 
meanwhile our correspondent overheard this discussion between cyrus mistry and rajdeep sardesai 
rajdeep sardesai so what i understand mr mistry is that you are concerned about the rising intolerance by the majority against the minorities in india 
cyrus mistry no i only said that i am concerned about the rising intolerance of the majority shareholders in tata sons against minority shareholders like me 
meanwhile aap leader ashutosh took to twitter to blast tata sons 
as per cyrus mistry tata motors nano plant in gujarat is making losses even industrialists in gujarat are losing money is this the gujarat model will modi answer he tweeted 
cyrus mistry spoke about risk of impairment in tata steal will ratan tata answer read his second tweet 
why was cyrus mistry not given a free hand to run tata suns will the bored answer said his third tweet 
a source who did not wish to be identified told our correspondent that tata sons is also planning to fire cyrus mistry from the board of directors and has already found his replacement 
after ratan tata asked for a versatile candidate with expertise in several fields and who is not afraid to speak his mind a consultant suggested the name of justice katju but ratan tata was not pleased at the prospect of being called an idiot in a board meeting and so vetoed the proposal instead congress leader ahmed patel will be filling this post 
according to our source the tata sons board was very impressed with ahmed patel after he told them that rather than abrupt firing they should have kept planting stories in the media like ratan tata unhappy with cyrus mistrys decision to close down tata steel uk business 
this along with his ability to effectively manage a family trust and also manage a professional ceo without letting him drift from the groups ethos and culture earned him a board seat 
further according to our source several names came up during the latest board meeting to pick a new chairman ahmed patel suggested the name of dr manmohan singh but ratan tata vetoed it saying he wanted a person who could be a brand ambassador for the tata group 
currently there are  persons who are frontrunners in the race for chairman one is arvind kejriwal several board members think that he will be a suitable candidate because he can just give speeches visit offices and be a brand ambassador while the actual work could be left to the board 
another name doing the round is chetan bhagat given his iit iim qualifications along with his versatile persona of being an author columnist screenwriter television personality and motivational speaker several board members think he is the perfect candidate for the heavily diversified salt to software conglomerate further he is good with numbers an area the tata group is struggling at this point in time",english,shiftfrequency.com,http://www.shiftfrequency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/StoneWaterSkyTree1-125x70.jpg,bs,0.0,november message archangel michael,gordon duff senior editor october radio host trump supporter claims jewish mafia controls us editors note insanity hit trump mouthpiece arch zionist alex jones warpath jewish mob israels newspapers shocked see trump grandson brothel owner son slum lord grew meyer lanskys mobrun new york became ingenuemoney boy jewish mob kingpin roy cohn roy cohn jewish mob built trumps empire ran interference gambinos john gotti company covering seems really important article published todays jerusalem post word true moreover obvious deflection piece written save trumps nazi supporters backing face vts slam dunk assertions trumps zionist fanaticism trump pushed war iran clearing west bank one state solution israel palestinians going chimneys americas jew haters human filth would gas americas jews big trump lovers comes nazi movement largely begun fundraiser adljdlaipacsplc lobby see swastikas painted synagogues big corporate donations alex jones brother nathaniel long accused rabid antizionist controversy alex bullhorn jones alleged zionist shill expanded apparent zionistjewish connections personal staff website advertisers link time warner president edgar bronfman jr jones seeming allegiance zionism explains virtually never targets zionist jews racist zionist rogue state israel engaging notorious rants attacks may well stem protestantzionist belief system widely circulated reports wife jew makes two children jewish talmudic law eligible israeli law return additional information jones site providing alex jones zionist connections prompting reticence expose global zionism becomes ever obvious trump played hate card day one building base hatred blacksafrican americans messicans course played terror card yellow hordes card elite liberal card well one aimed jews trump whose empire built roy cohn supported financed jewish organized crime vegas boss shelly adelson buy sell trump trump change always front jewish mob jewish mobsters oft pointed ian greenhalgh surrounded trump embarrassed imagine years ago nasty litigation radio host jeff rense former partner alex jones tracked jones backing jewish mob bronfman crime family accused complicity financing see zionist press pulling antisemite card alex jones one israels strongest supporters us joke course kind childishness would work brain dead jew hating nazis flocked trump trumps effusive love everything israel everything zionist one might ask nazis flock nazis never thinkers great followers even sent cliff like lemmings comment boards vt inundated paid trolls track back israel others employed trump surrogate operations tied campaign toads trolls get comment placed even wrong articles thus closed comments cut income source clean trash even though best money trump pays except hookers american jews going rise knees hit back well israel adl rising tide naziism us paid donations read doesnt laughing sorry humor find humor best g,1.0

mmmm going to be fun hunting them like nazis  but we know who the most entitled be  those we will proudly make our victims during ww httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuabiehbia already happily started slaughtering them all around the world  aidan rodrigo johansson 
the reason that american police love just shooting people instead of actually working and risking their safety for the safety of the people is because they are blood thirsty cowboy dirty harry brain washed psychopaths that love killing it is american culture at the root deep in the psyche 
the police have been militarized they dont do the job like in the old days no more negotiators drs or counselling at the scene of the crisis its just shoot bang bang boom yourr dead if you had a gun knife glow stick sandwich whatever gary honeycutt 
how old are you the old days you mention with negotiators and counselors came into vogue nationally in the s after a period of democrat rule notable for their most outstanding accomplishment a huge escalation of criminals rights over those of victims note the escalation of crime since then it seems you are also on the anticop bandwagon i support them being able to defend themselves mistakes can be made in a split second the same amount of time it might take for a criminal to kill a cop im sure you can name victims of cops do you realize what a small percentage of interactions between cops and the public they constitute unfortunately the justified shootings like the ferguson case are unfairly included in many of our perceptions first and foremost dont commit crime that improves your odds drastically next comply with orders given by the police if you were raised to treat the police as hostile someone failed you guilty or innocent comply the police are just trying to do their job dont complicate it ive seen many an arrest where a person taunts and struggles with the police even up to resisting being put in the car try walking a mile in their shoes they are trying to keep the public safe and they have a right to be safe themselves fluffnik 
guilty or innocent comply 
land of the free 
most places are successfully policed by consent and without shooting their citizens or suffering much crime gary honeycutt 
yes if an officer wants to see identification he has a reason if he wants you to keep your hands in plain sight he has a reason he is possibly ruling you out as a person of interest that was seen in the area imagine how much more efficiently that would go if each person would refrain from shouting about their rights for  minutes before complying if you are the person in question the transaction could be handled in a couple of minutes and youll be gone without any violence or hard feelings if you pay taxes you will have helped us get our moneys worth of course if youve seen the news and the reality shows you may have the impression that a lot of these guys that are giving a cop a load of crap probably live off of what you are paying to the government mike 
wasnt raised hostile to cops family members are cops as a matter of fact this is america if im not committing a crime or suspected of it dont ask me for papers dont detain me dont run dui checkpoints those are infringements on all of our freedom which i assume we love safety is what the left uses to excuse their behavior safety is a fallacy dufas_duck 
i have had  police officers in my extended family it got to the point that none of them were welcome into the rest of the familys homes they were eventually never invited to family get to gathers they were rude overbearing malicious individuals constantly bragging how they screwed some person and taught them how the world really should be their treatment of family members were more along the line of petty dictators where no matter the subject some familly member was wrong petty things like they didnt like the car they bought or their haircut or the job they worked at they were not satisfied with anything or anybody 
they brought their street attitude home with them they couldnt keep wives or husbands or significant others for very long they were arrogant mean and only thaought of themselvesanybody else was in their way 
i have seen gang members that have more ethics than these police and their freinds gary honeycutt 
my greatgrandfather his soninlaw my grandfatherand his son my uncle were all cops the oldest and youngest for their whole careers all deeply religious highly moral men dufas_duck 
that is great if they were straight arrow we need more like them my cop relatives and their friends would fit right in in the crips the bloods or just about any outlaw motorcycle club no one but other cops were proud of them my family sure wasnt proud of them gary honeycutt 
maybe they became hardened by what they faced daily east side of detroit south side of chicago people are products of their environment maybe the cops in branson mo and such places are nice guys what is the ratio of cops to citizens lets say youve got a playground with   year olds you get a dozen  year olds to keep order among them if the  are from sierra leone and the dozen are american boy scouts thered be  dead americans in short order any dead among the  wouldve been killed by their own so what do we expect of cops who grew up without a rap sheet graduated from school and passed the academy you think  years of patrolling the gnetto might change them they surely know the realities of the job better than we do how do the ones who arent in mayberry do a  or  year career in an inner city where shooting a cop makes you a hero and not resisting arrest makes you a pussy dufas_duck 
i do know that where i grew up the police at least tried to keep the officers from getting street hardened they rotated officers to different districts every month but then they found thst the police were trading assignments some cops didnt want to rotate out they wanted to stay where they were no explaination was given by any officerat least publically no answer was given 
many thought the cops were up to no good and wanted to stay in their own area to protct their interst dufas_duck 
you just gave the cops an excuse to act like gang members gary honeycutt 
i dont think so but you dont throw choirboys in blue to the wolves in the ghetto any more than you send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool dufas_duck 
 send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool 
you havent checked out what school cops have been doing as of late then a  year old in handcuffs or throwing an  year old to the ground doesnt work out to be the way to increase trust among the populace anthony fredericks 
i will end this stupidity of your right now gary i work with police every single day as a emt every day i am a qualified expert on how police act on scenemost of them are very arrogant rude and aggressive towards people shut up or be quiet is the first thing you normally hear from a cop you always see them put someone on the ground even if that person is the one who called them for help if they dont like youboom face down knee on your neck cuffs on approximately  are not like this but the other  are this is reality gary and i have worked in several cities in different areasand it is all the same police are overbearing and have a chip on their shoulder against the general publicand a lot of them take it out physically on them gary honeycutt 
my sympathies for the flaw in your familys dna dufas_duck 
luckily the flaw was only in the extended family treeinlaws marriages etc  gary honeycutt 
most people who oppose dui checkpoints have a reason ive always seen a problem with bars having parking lots when it is illegal for good reason to drink and drive i dont mind providing my id when a cop asks for it when its done without giving him any lip it is over quickly without incident hes just trying to do the job we are paying for if you want to launch into a  minute tirade about your rights youll be there  minutes longer make it a bad night at work for the cop and wind you all up maybe you like that some people love drama mike 
the reason is its an infringement on your rights and unnecessarily exposes you and the officers to a potentially dangerous confrontation there is no way you believe that unwanted contact that is forced upon officers and the public increases their safety i wouldnt blame the officers for the policies they have to enforce however the higher ups never pay when things go wrong after the fact the problem with being law abiding is that by doing nothing wrong you dont see the infringement of your rights and tolerate them just because you arent guilty of anything doesnt mean your rights arent being taken from you what if for safety we decided that all firearms need removed from private citizens what if we decided that tsa should run mandatory random checkpoints all over the us creating  hour delays what if we decided that anyone that supports trump may be a violent extremist and should be stopped for questioning do you see where this goes 
i dont like the immigration ones inside the states of the southwest i dont like the agricultural ones into california and i dont like the dui checkpoints in the south im a legal resident dont transport crops and dont drink yet i oppose all of them the idea behind them is wellmeaning the execution is unlawful imo obviously the courts dont think so or theyd not exist gary honeycutt 
it is the officers job to initiate that confrontation despite the risk to himself he does it to lessen the chance that a drunk will run over you daughter at a crosswalk he stops people who fit the description of a wanted person in hopes of catching a criminal before he claims another victim perhaps raping your daughter what would you do in his place mike 
you are confusing the issues here zero issue stopping and talking with someone who is suspected or witnessed committing a crime 
dui checkpoints are  stop and question with zero probable cause have you been in states where they run these the road is barricaded even turning around prior to the checkpoint leads to confrontation with the police as you are assumed to be committing a crime for not wanting to be questioned you are within your rights to be polite and refuse the checkpoint but the fact that they exist trouble me as do any checkpoints as they are not based on probable cause gary honeycutt 
and youve seen these checkpoints at pm by a suburban baptist church no the probable cause lies in them being near the strip at am where there is a history of alcoholrelated incidents mike 
i lived in the south these things were not targeting a specific demographic as far as i could tell and while not at pm that i can recall they werent that late and they sure could have been in front of a baptist church i could have been naive about who was being targeted i wasnt just waived through once they saw my skin color but my point is that the location doesnt matter nor does the target demographic if there is one they are unjust and just like every other forced interaction with law enforcement does not serve to increase the safety of leos 
if police pull me over because a car that looks like mine just robbed a quickie mart or a guy like me was just reported for beating his wife or ran off with a kid i do not have a problem with that they have probable cause and the risk to their safety and mine is worth it because they may be stopping a criminal stop me detain me for a reasonable time until they can prove i am or am not who they are looking for then let me be on my way 
however ive been stopped in a rural area for making a right turn on red perfectly legal in my state and the officer was a complete ass enough that had i a short fuse it could have quickly escalated after that encounter and talking with the state about why the previously posted no turn on red sign had been removed from that intersection for a couple of months the fact that this officers supervisor backed him up for an unlawful stop and threatening that they could have written me up and i would have to prove in court i didnt break the law just proved to me that some police are uninterested in doing what is right depending on the circumstances that officer had no reason to stop me although i suspect since it was near his house and he is a rural county officer he couldnt control his road rage and by doing so he put himself at risk as well as me there are a million what ifs in that situation not the least of which was the fact that even though he pulled me over in the dark along a fairly rural road by himself he didnt call in the stop which is procedure for that department i could have ended up shot or he could have and dispatch would have never known 
increasing negative interaction with the public is never in a leos best interest for safety and reputation of the police as a whole dufas_duck 
i guess thats why the police looking for a skinny black man that is wearing a white sweatshirt and is  foot that just commited a robbery would shoot a short foot  kid wearing a dark gray sweat shirt in the back as he was walking down the sidewalk at a fast pace turned out that the man they shot was pizza delivery in a hurry to deliver the next order before it cooled off 
police shooting two small white females in a light blue pickup truck while the cops were looking a huge black man in a dark gray pickup truck is perfectly aok 
in the town that i live in police shot and killed a  year old kid while he slept maybe we should all congraduate the officer because he only used three bullets he could have emptied his clip 
maybe the cops that you love are making things more efficient by killing anyone and everyone to save the taxpayers that you are so worried about any money a couple of bullets is cheaper than some cops time to find out what really is going on 
of course some of those evil peoples relitives will probably sue but so what the tax payers will take care of that 
how do you feel about cops who demand sex from some random female and when she refuses gets arrested for your noncompliance 
you would love my uncle he was a cop and really got off when he could beat or kill someone after about fifteen years of bullying beating killing and making false charges against people the force finally fired himmeanwhile he ruined hundreds of lives and they were not you welfare people that he abused it was anybody he could screw with 
but in your mind police can do no wrongmaybe you are right police are always telling us that they never do anything wrong especialy when they investigate themselves or have a friendly agency do the investigation gary honeycutt 
i dont deny that there are a small percentage of cops that shouldnt be or wrong splitsecond decisions sometimes think about how many police officers there have been over the span of time you draw your examples from think about the number of times per day that an leo comes in contact with a citizen that taken into account bad contacts are extremely rare the sensationalism of all these female teachers having sex with students is stuck in everyones mind but they dont consider the huge number of teachers and students and note how statistically rare these incidents are the incidents dont sour me on the entire education system we need law enforcement you are good at pointing out the flaws but do you have a solution will any form of policing be perfect what is dufas_duck 
how about having honest police and policing while percentage wise there is a small number of truley bad cops but there is always a but a large percentage of your good cops will keep silent lie or even cover for the bad cops that extends up through the ranks to the top of the police forces those honest cops that do come forward are setting themselves up to fail and eventually destroy their careerscops dont like whistleblowers 
the example you used teachers having sex with students is perfect once it is found that a teacher has crossed the line even a suspicion that the teacher has done something will bring immeadiate consequenses not so within the police a bad policeman can get away with things multiple times sometimes going on for years the upper eschalon figures out ways to cover for the errant cop at almost every turn even if convicted the court system will come in later on appeal and remove parts or all of any punishment 
for years the public was kept in the dark about the bad cop very few were brought to justice only the very extreme cases of crooked cops were adjudicated it is just lately after public attention that the police are starting to somewhat clean house 
there are child molesting police officers that are still working as officers many are just put on probation others are allowed to retun to police work after their incarceration 
it would also be a boon to the public if we had a justice system instead of a legal system a legal system can be whatever its practicinors want it to be a justice system looks for truth no matter where it points to quilified and absolute immunity for police das judges does not lend itself to anything close to justice 
police are a necessary evilthe are some evil people in the world it is just too bad that many of them are police officers gary honeycutt 
keep silent lie or even cover turn off the tv and go out i to the world some will agree with you but if youd said the same thing about black people thered be trouble dont you think just about any group might share the same likelihood of bending the rules they also dont like criminals in uniform and are just as likely to line up against a bad apple do cops get away with small indiscretions and occassionally a major crime probably but more so than the general population interesting take on the teacher thing i remember a fellow who got a job as a girls basketball coach at a very small rural school he was no prize in his youth and i guess when an equally awkward underage player on his team developped a crush on him he couldnt resist she got pregnant and to add to a volatile situation her uncle was the superintendent of schools flash ahead maybe  years give or take and im a teacher and football coach in that same system at a slightly larger rural school i work with a married couple both tenured teachers probably on full retirement now after full careers without ever being fired downsized transferred or any of the other things that may befall teachers during their careers the hubby is the boys basketball coach and unofficially the assistant principle guess who yep dufas_duck 
ive been out in the world for over  years been beat by cops and then have them later discover i wasnt the perp they were looking for i was only lucky in that the cops didnt make up charges to cover their tails they just lied about what went down and covered for each other in this instance everything happened because i was driving the same make model color and year of vehicle that was used in a felony crime on the way to jail a radio message came in telling the cops to stand down the perp had been caught and identified the cops just turned around and dumped me back at my vehicle 
i think if you would reread what i posted it was the cops that i refered to as being giged for turning in another cop not the teachers in todays world a teacher will be messed with just on a rumer if you as a coach had rumers that you were messing with the kids i dont think you would have lasted in that positionunless you are stating you were messing with the kids and no on ratted on you gary honeycutt 
no i wasnt referring to myself i was an outsider where the good ol boy superintendent had a slew of relatives and even more buddies on the payroll i think the guy in my story shouldve done time and never been allowed to work with kids again dufas_duck 
addendum 
i get the feelig that you are the type that if a policeman makes a mistake the officer should get a pass because everybody makes mistakes police are supposed to be trained on how to back off those split second decisions even in the military soldier makes a mistake and if it is not covered up the soldier faces the consequenses but there are many that think that the killing some kid by a policeman is aok like the two policemen that were canvassing a nieghborhood knocking on doors and a  year old kid opens the door while holding a ps game controller cop shouts gun and  shots lateran innocent kid is dead and bleeding out in his own home while the playstation is running in the background and the cops get another pass thats the kind of policing that you want 
yet a mechanic makes a mistake while repairing or sevicing your vehicle and it leads to a death of an innocent personthe mechanic can be held liable both were mistakeswhy should a mechanic be held responsible and the cop not be anthony fredericks 
theres no excuse for killing a person gary we have laws against that no im sorry brings back people after being killed by over reacting cops no gary accidents like that are not excusable i dont care what job you have soldiers in warzones who kill innocent people are brought up on charges of murder why would it be ok for a stupid beat cop to be able to do it gary honeycutt 
selfdefense is a valid reason and the police have as much right to it as anyone and more likelihood to find themselves in that situation due to the nature of their jobs people like to argue the case of an unarmed attacker should only mma champions be allowed to be cops an unarmed attacker can kill you if someone breaks into my house at night i will do whatever it takes to keep him from doing harm to myself or family i will not wait to see if hes armed or ask his intentions i wont refrain from using a weapon because i dont see him with one it is not a high school wrestling match we wont get up and shake hands after it is decided by score if this same criminal finds me awake and decides to leave at once i will call a cop it is his job to confront this person and resistance by the suspect places him in the same situation i was in when someone invaded my home fluffnik 
i live in scotland where the police do not routinely carry guns mostly noone dies anthony fredericks 
you mean like the guy who got shot in his car for trying to give his id to the cop or maybe you are talking about the social worker that was trying to bring back his autistic patient and the com while he was on his back with his hands straight in the air how about those huh gary i could go on and on but a close minded sheep like you would never see the forest through the trees anthony fredericks 
so gary if i seen you walking towards me on the street got scared because you looked dangerous and i accidentally defended myself by blowing your head off then all i have to say is oh sorry my bad and because accidents happen everything is ok right take your head out of the sandpolice kill people when they think their authority is being challenged not their lives they are protecting their egos mike 
while i wont disagree completely with your statement blanket statements are never correct some police may kill from challenges to authority in most cases it is a kill or be killed split second decision that we not being in the exact same position should not second guess what we should be secondguessing are the supervisors chiefs and elected officials who hire bad cops improperly train their officers and put officers in harms way where they should not be the higherups never pay the price for those under them whose actions they are responsible for that is a very real problem if we want change we need to hold our elected officials responsible for the behavior of the officers that indirectly work for them 
programs such as stop and frisk checkpoints etc all require a confrontation with individuals that do not need to occur that puts officers and the publics lives at risk neither is acceptable the easy solution is to stop making the confrontations occur but you do something stupid michael brown you deserve what you get 
i wish organizations like black lives matter would pick individuals to use as martyrs who were actually victims there are a lot of people who would agree with some of the basic ideas espoused but when you choose the perpetrators of crime who just happened to get theirs as your martyrs you expose your cause as being about something other than justice gary honeycutt 
you can put that example back where you pulled it fromif your head isnt in the way bj 
thats actually standard in every part of the world except usa its normal for police to protect and serve  it is not normal for police to shoot first ask later jack mccauley

David G. Brown,2016-11-06T16:01:07.482+02:00,federal jury finds uva rape hoax journalist sabrina rubin erdely and rolling stone liable for defamation,"the media is beginning to demonize the manosphere and alt right twitter has suspended multiple accounts such as milo yiannopoulos ricky vaughn and matt forney the guardian wrote a hit piece against the red pill  the media has called altright groups xenophobic racist and misogynist despite not pointing to a single piece of evidence
as antitrump rallies continue to rage across the nation in new york city philadelphia and michigan the media completely ignores all of the assaults occurring on trump voters

despite the elites attempts to destroy us we are in fact winning this battle the reasons why are simple
truth is always more powerful than falsehood we are too numerous to be effectively silenced we dont congregate on one single platform were a collection of individuals based around an ideology were high energy decisive assertive and confident men below i would like to offer the supporters of our causes some signs of hope victory is near and trump is going to lead the way
 george soros being sued for  million 
according to breitbart  along with dozens of other alternative news sites dallas police department sergeant demetrick pennie president of the dallas fallen officer foundation is suing a multitude of individuals for inciting a race war
george soros hillary clinton jesse jackson barrack obama the new black panthers and more some individuals might claim that theres no way someone can take on this collection of massively powerful and wealthy elites in a single lawsuit and they may be right however whether or not this lawsuit is successful is completely irrelevant
what matters far more is that the word is starting to get out there the president of the dallas fallen officer foundation an extremely reputable organization is taking steps to file a massive lawsuit against these individuals this will at the very least do several things
potentially serve a massive blow to the globalists show the elites that we will not back down generate huge amounts of public awareness show the average gun rights promoting masculine traditional american that they have our support and best of all the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas which means that the outcome will generally be good either way
first of all theres a very high likelihood of them winning due to the case being handled in texas a highly conservative state second in the event that the case doesnt win it will likely be pursued all the way to the supreme court if this occurs expect truly amazing things to happen the reason why the president of the united states is responsible for appointing supreme court judgesand guess whos going to be president in two months
 the grubhub crash 
after matt maloney ceo of the online food delivery service grubhub proclaimed in an email that if you agree with trumps politics you should resign their stock dropped by nearly  in just a few days
since this time in addition to his companys stock tanking he has received ample backlash on sites of all manner from twitter to facebook to reddit to independent blogs to major altright news centers
this is what my fellow rok contributors and manosphere bloggers were talking about when they mentioned the tangible impact of trump voters hillarys supporters lack the characteristics necessary to make change
a burning passion and sense of purpose moral fortitude and a sense of justice selfconfidence and the courage to stand up for your rights a fucking spine this is why we will win period the antitrump crowd is based around having a massive entitlement complex a victim complex not thinking for yourself and being a blind social sheep do people like this ever have any political or financial power in the world
of course not who do you think all of the hard working businessmen are all of the entrepreneurs all of the people investing in the stock market in order to take control of their financial future hard working intelligent men who dont make excuses obviously and do you know what these are the types of men that voted for donald trump
why do you think the dow jones industrial average is at an all time high because trumps win restored faith in america
 rise of the new media 
the mainstream media has repeatedly shown to be completely incompetent in regards to actually reporting on the issues they are nothing more than a puppet show meant to distract entertain and brainwash the american public
they have consistently lied about candidates manipulated the evidence falsified facts skewed statistics and polls and defamed multiple individuals for a mere political opinion this will happen no longer
with the rise of the new media more and more men have begun establishing outlets across all platforms reddit twitter facebook youtube periscope the list goes on and on
i firmly believe that the next eight years will be looked back on by historians as one of the most important times in all of humanitys time on this earth 
america has brought the world stability we have stood as a symbol and an ideal for other countries to follow we are a monolith of free speech bravery and economic prosperityand the elites have tried to destroy all of this to satisfy their greedy little egos
the men of america will not have this over the past  years cough obamas presidency cough we have seen an exponential increase in not only the quantity of alternative news outlets but also the quality
sites that were merely blogs a few years ago have evolved into fullblown news syndicates with live reporting onsite video footage and actual news anchors this is literally the people fighting back we want freedom of speech and we will have it
while the mainstream media draws its final breath theyre proclaiming that theres this new radical whitenationalist group called the altright in an attempt to make us look like evil fascists in fact i just had somebody threaten to kill me on twitter  but was he banned of course not
this repeated favoring of violent mentally ill leftists makes it very clear what the msms agenda istotal control and a complete suppression of our freedoms of speech sorry but the alternative media isnt going to let this happen
 massive boycotts of antitrump companies 
the lefts hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me somehow they can completely legally destroy an independent family owned business for simply refusing to bake a gay couple a cake but when trump supporters simply boycott a multibillion dollar conglomerate were the ones that are hateful
in response to several ceos statements regarding trumps racism and hate the men and women who voted for donald trump decided to simply boycott them despite this completely legal and antiviolent response the left is up in arms
here is a list of companies whose ceos have been caught attacking donald trump and his proamerican policies
pepsico they own pepsi lays mountain dew starbucks and more nabisco their brands include oreo chips ahoy ritz and more netflix macys ben  jerrys each and every single one of these companies has either spoken out against trump directly has refused to do business with trump or has moved factory production outside of the us such as nabisco which has started moving production to mexico some companies such as ben  jerrys have even openly supported the terrorist movement black lives matter 
again what do these actions signify in trump supporters power assertiveness courage a willingness to take action this is why donald trump wonhis supporters are grown ups not little babies who want more safe spaces and antifree speech zones
when donald trumps voters get oppressed by the biased controlled media or by elite globalists they dont whine or cry about it they just do something they protest and stop supporting companies that are shipping our jobs away they speak out in a logical rational way against the anger and hatred that the left has towards white men
they take their lives into their own hands rather than relying on a stupid system that caters to cry babies and whiners they take their health into their own hands they take their finances into their own hands and they take their relationships into their own hands
they dont wait around for someone else to do it for themthey get it done themselves this is why trump got into office and this is why were going to make america great again

donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day trump tweeted monday morning why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive 
its a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process 
states backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process sen jeff flake of arizona who is often sharply critical of trump tweeted sunday elections are not rigged 
jon husted the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged 
trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls before now trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august 
and im telling you november  wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august and i hope the republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us 
multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election 
allen raymond a former gop operative who was involved in the  new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the republic 
the idea that its rigged i dont know what hes talking about he said in august i know someone that rigged elections i mean you know the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesnt need to rig this election trumps going to win alabama and thats it she doesnt have to do anything its painful to watch 
raymond wrote how to rig an election confessions of a republican operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the  new hampshire senate election between thengov jeanne shaheen a democrat and republican us rep john e sununu raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out sununu went on to win the election by roughly  votes shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in  
the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementhe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what trumps talking about 
the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in  against republican nominee mitt romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican 
i dont even know what hes talking about raymond said but this idea that its  or  and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense an election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about now its stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire 
he said the lack of voterid laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus 
these voterid laws whats the intention of that the clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterid laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots you know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore because its unconstitutional 
people dont vote  times he continued there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort its a total myth 
he said trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline hillary clintons first four years in office 
the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both trump and sen bernie sanders of vermont clintons main opponent in the democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season the emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored clinton 
trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against sanders in his earlyaugust interview with hannity in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail he used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/1477586227636130853168961052.jpg,conspiracy,0.0,trump warns world war iii clinton elected,email donald trump riling voting base claims november election rigged course large scale voter fraud happening election day trump tweeted monday morning republican leaders deny going naive charge even republicans quick refute critics called talk potentially dangerous detrimental trust us democratic process states backed tens thousands gop dem volunteers ensure integrity electoral process sen jeff flake arizona often sharply critical trump tweeted sunday elections rigged jon husted secretary state ohio top election official key battleground state also said monday could assure trump election would rigged trumps recent claims coincided plunge polls trump recently made similar claims polls numbers taking dive early august im telling november wed better careful election going rigged new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity august hope republicans watching closely going taken away us multiple republicans told business insider time trumps assertion ludicrous dangerous trump would first us presidential candidate modern times possibly ever blame election loss voter fraud rigged election allen raymond former gop operative involved new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence election would rigged detrimental republic idea rigged dont know hes talking said august know someone rigged elections mean know fact matter hillary clinton doesnt need rig election trumps going win alabama thats doesnt anything painful watch raymond wrote rig election confessions republican operative tellall attempt rig new hampshire senate election thengov jeanne shaheen democrat republican us rep john e sununu raymond said attempted rigging centered jamming phone lines new hampshire democrats office manchester task phone bank hired carry sununu went win election roughly votes shaheen defeated sununu rematch operative served brief prison sentence involvementhe said attempts rig election would look similar trumps talking manhattan billionaire told washington post august lack voteridentification laws would let people keep voting voting voting suggested fraud occurred republican nominee mitt romney precincts practically nobody voting republican dont even know hes talking raymond said idea party bosses going roll pittsburgh philadelphia going rig ballot box rig machines thats nonsense election rigging days means something totally different hes talking stupid stuff like new hampshire said lack voterid laws trump trying use proof fraud fall also bogus voterid laws whats intention clear intention disenfranchisement said echoing common complaint liberal circles voterid laws put place prevent minority voting blocks able cast ballots know theres reason dont poll tax anymore unconstitutional people dont vote times continued might one bad actor every tries vote couple times hes talking institutional effort total myth said trumps statements attempt basically sideline hillary clintons first four years office idea rigged election came forefront democratic national committee emails hacked leaked though trump sen bernie sanders vermont clintons main opponent democratic primary claimed electoral system rigged earlier primary season emails showed organization supposed remain neutral throughout primary favored clinton trump said email leak proved primary election rigged sanders earlyaugust interview hannity addition claims perpetuated along campaign trail used leak evidence fall election would rigged well,1.0
Don Wrightman,2016-11-23T22:47:00.000+02:00,nyt credibility destroyed by  simple questions from newt gingrich,"share on twitter print this post 
in a conference call with reporters hillary clintons campaign manager said that fbi director comeys letter is backfiring and energizing clintons volunteers to work harder and her supporters are voting in even bigger numbers 
clinton campaign chair john podesta called comeys letter long on innuendo short on facts podesta said the more information that comes out the more this seems overblown podesta went off on rep jason chaffetz for distorting the facts and undermining his own legitimacy by claiming that the investigation was reopened podesta said that comey had provided selective information that allowed partisans to distort the facts 
podesta said theres no evidence of wrongdoing no charge of wrongdoing he said if all the media reports are true about the investigation having nothing to do with hillary clinton its hard to see how this amounts to anything 
hillary clintons campaign chair called on comey to provide answers to be public 
clinton campaign manager robbie mook said that the comey letter is motivating clinton volunteers and supporters 
based on the anecdotes i am hearing from out team on the ground this situation has created an urgency and intensity among our volunteers and activists that was already high because we are so close to the election our volunteers are rallying around hillary they know what a fighter she is 
 
they are turning out not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote as early voting goes into full swing were not just seeing this in our offices on the ground but also in our online in the online space as well i think this is we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday i think that this has only increased the momentum that were feeling among our activists on the ground 
later mook suggested that the comey letter is helping the clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire it is likely that the comey letter will backfire on republicans and motivate democrats to get out and support their nominee 
an early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters hillary clinton may end up benefiting from comeys actions because the fbi director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-30T02:33:26.184+02:00,obamas un ambassador cuba is right about our human rights,"obamas attorney general warned fbi director not to inform congress of new hillary investigation   
the media is shamelessly spinning this corrupt behavior by attorney general lynch as standard protocol and blasting the fbi from deviating from some imaginary standard in which democratic presidential candidates are supposed to be immune from the consequences of their criminality  and congress is meant to be kept in the dark 
attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates disagreed with fbi director james comeys decision to notify congress about his bureaus review of emails potentially related to hillary clintons personal server law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said 
there was no direct confrontation between lynch or yates and comey instead the disagreements were conveyed to comey by justice department staff who advised the fbi chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election the officials said 
it is in line with policy though for lynch to have met with bill clinton 
but yes a hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate 
comeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter friday anyway shaking the presidential race  days before the election and nearly four months after the fbi chief said he wouldnt recommend criminal charges over the democratic nominees use of the server 
the officials acknowledged there was little lynch and yates could do given the fallout over lynchs controversial meeting over the summer with former president bill clinton 
note how the media is spinning this as comeys drastic course of action while lynch is just being a responsible public servant the default assumption is that comey is in the wrong for providing information to one of the major branches of government and the greater public",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/big-sister-600x337_2.jpg?itok=EmETEtUf,hate,1.0,huma abedin swore oath emails lied,sioux indians wish dakota pipeline protesters would go home october daniel greenfield ecoloons protesting dakota pipeline support media white house many local sioux dont see defenders wish would go home ask around youll hear stories pipeline protesters whove traveled great distances theyve come japan russia germany australia israel serbia course allies exclusively native american indigenous whove flocked corners us demonstrating proud daily work obnoxious leftists world united want pipelines showers one makes clearer robert fool bear sr district chairman cannon ball town runs estimated population miles action close given faceoffs law enforcement pass police checkpoint reach time people heard folks like says fool bear protesters says two years ago members standing rock sioux tribe could attended hearings make concerns known didnt care suddenly crowds control fears matter time someone gets seriously hurt go camps says wont see many standing rock sioux irks people world says could come planets think would sioux stuck helping leftist idiot protesters long ago found three teenage girls ontario canada camped inside storage shed white woman spokane washington came see help saying shed come nothing car broken casino recently someone approached two young kids parents arrested even though fool bear protests doesnt mean hes preparing help people anticipates opening community gymnasium people without beds come winter growing pile sleeping bags blankets sits office protesters arizona georgia california wont know hit cold rushes says instead helping sioux privileged leftists become burden take care,1.0
Alex Ansary,2016-11-07T20:01:08.718+02:00,kremlin nato was created for agression,"janet reno first female us attorney general dies at   
npr 
janet reno the first woman to serve as attorney general of the united states died early monday from complications of parkinsons disease renos goddaughter gabrielle dalemberte and sister margaret hurchalla confirmed her passing to npr 
reno spent her final days at home in miami surrounded by family and friends dalemberte told the associated press she was  
reno served longer in the job than anyone had in  years and her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy but she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments 
she was not president bill clintons first choice to head the justice department nor his second but after his no  pick went down in confirmation flames and his second choice also proved controversial clinton finally turned to reno 
she was an unexpected pick she had no connections to clinton or washington but clinton wanted a woman and reno was a bigtime prosecutor holding the top prosecutors job in miamidade county a position she had been elected to four times over  years 
jamie gorelick who would later become deputy attorney general was assigned to prep reno for her confirmation hearing she was the least airbrushed candidate we have ever had for a cabinetlevel position says gorelick she was herself and she didnt change herself for washington 
reno arrived at the justice department knowing no one and was immediately plunged into the siege at the branch davidian compound outside waco texas four federal agents had been killed and  wounded while serving a warrant to search for illegal guns seven weeks into the siege pressed by the fbi reno authorized a raid on the compound resulting in  deaths including as many as  children and the davidian leader david koresh who ordered his followers to set fire to the compound 
in two sets of waco congressional hearings over the next two years reno would successfully quell critics on the right and left 
what haunted me reno explained at one hearing was that if i did not go in i might be sitting there  days later  when koresh came out with explosives blew himself some agents and the entire place up 
years later however in an interview with npr shortly before leaving office her regret was palpable well never know whether it was a mistake or not in one sense reno admitted but knowing what i do i would not do it again i would try to figure another way 
waco didnt make her hesitant it made her insistent about getting her own information observes walter dellinger who served in two top justice department jobs under reno 
dellinger believes for instance that it may have been the waco experience that led reno to go personally to miami in april  to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of yearold cuban refugee elián gonzález from the home of a greatuncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent in cuba 
elián had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the united states rescued by fishermen and brought to the us he was soon turned over to his greatuncle the cuban community in miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father who lived in cuba and the furor soon bled over to congress 
but when negotiations with the greatuncle failed armed federal agents acting on renos orders raided the home removed elián and turned him over to his father who had come to the us to receive his son when the us supreme court refused to intervene the two returned to their home in cuba 
janet reno takes the oath as attorney general during a ceremony at the white house on march   while president bill clinton watches 
barry thummaap 
over the course of time reno would become embroiled in many controversies she sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow cabinet members and president clinton himself but she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the clintongore campaign after justice department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president 
the decision so infuriated republicans that some called for her impeachment this is the most politicized justice department in the history of the united states railed dan burton the republican chairman of a key house oversight committee 
at  feet  inches however reno stood tall in the political crosswinds gorelick observes that when members of congress like burton were unhappy with a government official they threatened to call that official to testify but reno who had served as a staffer in the florida state legislature always said fine ill be there as a result says gorelick eventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that because she prevailed in every outing that i can recall  she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her 
the controversies that the justice department faced during renos reign often eclipsed the many things that went well the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the oklahoma city bombers for example the pursuit of bombers of womens health clinics that provide abortions and the solving of the socalled unabomber case 
after nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit the fbi still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the unabomber who had killed three people and injured  then in  the bomber sent a letter to the new york times offering to cease his terror campaign if the times or the washington post would publish his word manifesto against modern industry and technology neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially but reno the daughter of two newspaper journalists persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety 
it paid off the unabombers brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the fbi ending the bombers long reign of terror theodore kaczynski aka the unabomber is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison 
in  reno was diagnosed with parkinsons disease she did not slow down but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing she even joked about the disease claiming that shaking sometimes helps as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak 
that combination of toughness and selfdeprecating humor plus her determination to protect the justice department from improper influence made her a hero to many who worked for her 
janet reno led with her values says former deputy attorney general gorelick the departments no  official and that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her  id never seen that before in quite the same way 
florida gubernatorial candidate and former us attorney general janet reno speaks at the florida democratic party state conference on april   in lake buena vista fla she lost the democratic primary 
reno won enormous respect inside the department as well because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the justice department  from national security to environmental questions to the generally obscure field of indian law 
us attorney general loretta lynch called her one of the most effective decisive and wellrespectedleaders in the departments proud history who never shied from criticism or shirked responsibility and former attorney general eric holder said that in a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain janet reno stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values 
former solicitor general dellinger believes that reno was prepared for the attorney generals job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height this is a woman that went to cornell and harvard law school at a time when very few women went to harvard law school went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart  and thats really really tough 
there were of course ups and downs in the eight years of renos reign but she said she always took the long view of her job 
if the end brings me out right what people said about me wont make any difference and if the end brings me out wrong  angels saying i was right wont make any difference she said in an interview with npr in  
president clinton made little secret of his frequent displeasure with reno and the wall of separation she erected between the justice department and the white house still he never asked her to resign reno was the last cabinet member he reappointed after his reelection in  
it was actually quite wonderful said dellinger she just decided to stay and it turns out that nobody could fire her 
the tension between clinton and his attorney general was apparent even as clintons time in office drew to a close in an interview with cbs news  minutes  clinton went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike but when it came to his evaluation of reno he was tepid to say the least 
good woman he said tried really hard to do a good job shes a good person 
at least he didnt say i was a bad person replied reno with a laugh ill take what i can get 
indeed by the end of her tenure janet reno had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian will ferrells parody of her became one of the iconic skits on nbcs saturday night live  the recurring skit was inspired by reports that reno had cut quite a figure dancing at a justice department party 
on the last episode of the janet renos dance party parody ferrell wearing a blue dress and pearls reminisces about past glories and laments that the end of the party is near then suddenly the real janet reno comes crashing through the wall of the set wearing the same blue dress and pearls as ferrell to deliver one of ferrells signature lines its reno time 
oh janet he says to the real reno as he mourns the end of the skits run what do you do when you get sad

  ethan a huff staff writer tags smoking age  california  prohibition naturalnews if youre between the ages of  and  live in california and are a smoker expect to be denied your favorite pack at the convenience store beginning in june the new minimum age for officially jumped from  to  a prohibition move that lawmakers claim will curb the number of smokers in the golden state and ultimately help save livesjoining both hawaii and the city of needham in massachusetts california is the third locale in the us to raise the legal smoking age to  officials there hope that like in these other places age restrictions on smoking will help reduce the number of smokers and minimize the number of individuals who develop smokingrelated health conditions like emphysema and lung cancerciting statistics from needham that show a nearly  percent reduction in the number of smokers in the fiveyear period following the change that was made in  april roeseler head of the california public health departments tobacco control program told the los angeles times that she expects similar reductions in her statein needham the number of high schoolers smoking cigarettes fell by nearly half according to a study published last year and adult smoking rates in the town also fell from about  percent to a mere  percent  statistics that experts say can be replicated all across the countryif we can push that age up where fewer and fewer people start smoking as a teen its likely that we will start to have some tobaccofree generations  the times quotes her as saying prohibition never works people who want contraband will find a way at this point though very little if any evidence exists to show that the rule change is working as intended university of california san francisco ucsf professor dr stanton glantz for instance admitted to the times that the policy still needs time to settle in the california smokers helpline also says it hasnt noticed any increases in the number of callers in the prohibited age range trying to quit which suggests that not much has changedtheres also the contraband factor  older kids still buying cigarettes for younger kids for example including those younger than the former threshold age of  illegal buying has always been an issue law or no law which is something that the government never really seems to understand when it comes to issues of prohibition theyre hanging out and partying together so theyll just get someone else to buy says leonard charles the owner of a liquor store in oakland charles says he strictly enforces the new cigarette age law but believes that if somebody wants cigarettes he or she is going to find a way regardless of the lawin the internet age cigarettes are also freely available to anybody with a wifi connection people can order cigarettes off the web and have them delivered right to their doorstep which means that statelevel restrictions are basically mootand what about ecigarettes the state of california classifies ecigs as a tobacco product just like cigarettes and they are subject to the same laws however everybody has them these days theyre very discreet and they dont produce that typical tobacco smell thats so hard to get out of a room  so trying to enforce restrictions against their use is next to impossible say experts familiar with the reality of how easy it is to obtain tobacco regardless of what the law sayswhen asked how the new law will realistically work in light of the fact that smoking laws often arent effective glantz responded the short answer is i dont know sources for this

military officials in tunisia have rejected claims that the country is hosting a base for us drone operations against the daesh takfiri terrorist group in neighboring libya 
tunisias defense minister farhat horchani on thursday ruled out any possibility that foreign forces could have direct access to tunisian military bases or run their own in the country 
we dont  and wont  have a foreign military base in tunisia horchani said adding we were one of the few first countries to oppose a foreign military intervention in libya 
a tunisian defense ministry spokesman also said on thursday that the north african country has never allowed washington to operate unmanned planes from its territory for antidaesh missions 
tunisian soil has never been and never will be used to strike targets in libya the drones are used by tunisians and no one else belhassen oueslati said adding as part of tunisianus bilateral cooperation we have acquired drones to train our military personnel to use this technology and to control our southeastern border with libya and detect any suspicious movement 
the remarks came after us media claimed that washington has expanded its deployment of drones to north africa as part of a secret program 
a report by the washington post said on wednesday that unmanned aircraft and us military personnel had been deployed to a facility in tunisia to conduct spy missions in neighboring libya the paper added that drones began flying out of the tunisian base in late june claiming that the dispatch of the planes was a key element of the extended us air offensive against a daesh stronghold in libya 
daesh which is known for its terror acts in iraq and syria has been operating mostly in northern libya a country which slipped into chaos in  following the ouster of longtime dictator muammar gaddafi 
forces loyal to libyas unity government which enjoy the support of the west and the united nations have been battling daesh militants over the past six months in the coastal city of sirte 
us africa command africom said on thursday that since august  pentagon has carried out  airstrikes in libya to help libyan forces in the fight in sirte 
there are us service members working with the tunisian security forces for counterterrorism and they are sharing intelligence from various sources to include unarmed aerial platforms said colonel mark r cheadle spokesman for us africa command

Troy Francis,2016-11-02T18:01:28.236+02:00,habits all successful seducers share,"one of the foundations of living a good life in todays times is having a good place to call home whether you want a solid comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies recover from the days tribulations and just to be or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits or both a good home is essential to the modern man
i purchased a home and i decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations my home was an asoriginallyfurnished home of the s and i brought its multicolor painted green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed hardwoodfloored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style a general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site source the labor follow the schedule get the materials and execute the vision of the plan here are ten things i learned as my own general contractor
 there are good contractors and there are bad contractors 
you will run into both good and bad contractors out there a good contractor does good work at good value follows the schedule and is honest and doesnt lie to you a bad contractor will do any or all of the above i fired a contractor who had good value but did poor work could not follow the schedule and lied to me i paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work hit the schedule on time and was a perfectionist give a bad contractor a second chance mainly to see how he corrects it and if he fails to shape up cut him loose
a good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork but no more some firms i turned down did things by hand and had no contractors license and that is too little whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanics lien on your home if you do not pay is too much
a lot has to do with the presentation of the representative tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands but a man that does not have a good handshake good eye contact and is evasive on important details is shady
 good contractors cost more and they are busy the best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule and i mean they are booked often a month or so in advance the guy i fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night which while it seems like hes busy hes actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs
a good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them and he will when awarded the job put you in his schedule at an agreedupon time my best contractor was so busy that i had to do other things first before i could get his firm to bid my work and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy they turned down my work until later
 you need to establish a reputation 
general contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they subcontract to and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation
a busy contractor will work with a gc who will give them work in the future over one who will not i was an unknown so the busy guys during the busy season fall and preholidays would pass on me and work with ones they knew
however word got around to the others that i gave jobs of good scope and paid on time i hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs and once they found out who i used as my electrician it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to they called and the electricians vouched that i was picky as all hell but paid on time and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house at that point i was in
 good contractors know other good contractors 
reputation works the other way too a good roofer who i only turned down because he was too busy and wouldnt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above although you should always get multiple competing quotes bid to three two will generally respond and pick the better one the deciding factor was that his brother the roofer ran a good shop and it stood to reason he would too
my plumbers knew my ac guys and my chimney guy my flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys everyone works with and around everyone else and i saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that on any future projects i know who to call for what and even if i dont know i know who to ask for recommendations
 it will take more money than you think it will 
home renovation is expensive and its mainly for the nasty reason that once you commit to action you can get hit with extra costs you can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what but you will find that the home will need things you didnt think about or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted or materials will simply cost more
part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now and what to spend money on later right now i live in the place finally but i still have construction paper down on my floors as i have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas my bathrooms have plumbing in but no mirrors cabinets towel racks or toilet paper holders entire rooms are without furniture all of these can and should be taken care of later but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier
 it will take more time than you think it will you may not need something this complicated but a gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others
contractors have their own schedules and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit you have to juggle quotes they have to then write you in then they do the work then theres followups and punchlists and then finally that job is done and you pay them
you cant do some other jobs before you finish the first one this is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters my floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors but they did not when they were laying subfloor and i was able to have plumbers in that day as well contrariwise i could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done
 some of your ideas are wrong some are right i had my own thoughts about what to do with the place sometimes i was wrong it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood even though it was the same color and i listened to my contractor and used new sometimes i was right my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the countertops colors and the ratio of white i wanted was correct but i was persuaded to add more by my contractor
know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how instead of the what i have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures they did what i wanted but did it in a better way than i would have suggested and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process
 there will be gaps in your manpower coverage 
the one thing a professional general contractor does that you as a private operator will not is do all the basic stuff themselves a gc will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself my electricians did install and hang them for me anyway
this was for two reasons and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job the first is to provide all the materials yourself which also allows you to pick out what you want i had a pile of fixtures fans and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done
the second reason is to provide a good scope of work will a plumber come install a single faucet maybe will he come install five and a garbage disposal certainly thats a good days work so if you have little jobs have a lot of little jobs and youll get more interest
 there are things with which you will not be satisfied good enough is good enough 
this house is old but renovated some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval i cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is  years old and it had popcorn texture on it some things i did not address i have new baseboard and new window trim but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time
some things were done but were not perfect the drywall where my kitchen cabinets bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where even after two reworks still has a hairline paint crack some of the window film has pull away lines and theres a couple things trapped under the film in places one of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue you cannot have perfection but you can go for reasonable excellence
 code enforcement sucks the man sucks someone called code enforcement on me and i had to go get a permit of a cost of x of the renovations cost mainly so they can jack my taxes up
i got the permit and i expect my taxes to go up the inspector was a real schmuck as most appointed officials are but the jokes on him as i only got the permit on what i had left to do and i omitted some things that would still happen but werent too noticeable
with code enforcement and county ordinances the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken instead of flouting the law i went and got the permit when i was busted for it but they only know a third of the story had i gotten a permit earlier perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all another tactic which i will do on a future project i have planned is to get the permit months ahead of time then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices
conclusion if you have the time the patience and the skill to know exactly what you want who to get for it and how to juggle a massive schedule running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational if you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead

Relampago Furioso,2016-11-15T15:01:54.543+02:00,ways the media responded with butthurt to donald trumps victory,"with the media gripped by accusatory speculation regarding the identity of the source behind the wikileaks leak of hacked podesta and dnc emails much of it focused on russia a new theory has emerged from craig murray the former british ambassador to uzbekistan who tells sputnik a russian media outlet that the source of the leaks are not russian hackers but a washington insider
the source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended the sam adams whistleblower award in washington the source of these emails comes from within official circles in washington dc you should look to washington not to moscow 

asked about whether or not wikileaks have ever published information at the behest of moscow murray said that wikileaks has never published any material received from the russian government or from any proxy of the russian government its simply a completely untrue claim designed to divert attention from the content of the material
while blasted by washington first by republicans several years ago and most recently by democrats the wikileaks revelations have often been hailed as a champion of accountability
i think whistleblowers have become extremely important in the west because the propaganda model  as chomsky puts it  has been reinforced to the extent that people dont get any true information out of the media at all its worth saying that julian assange and wikileaks are publishers they publish what whistleblowers leak to them mr murrary told sputnik
yet whistleblowers in the us continue to be subject to lengthy prison sentences a key example is chelsea manning who was sentenced on august   to a thirty five year sentence for providing wikileaks with sensitive military and diplomatic documents highlighting among other things us military conduct in iraq murray also mentions the case of john kiriakou a former investigator of international terrorism with the cia who turned whistleblower
the people who did the torture have suffered no comeback at all adds mr murray
taking a step back and discussing the risk of geopolitical escalation between russia and the us murray told sputnik that there is no chance whatsoever that russia is going to ever attack the united states that simply isnt going to happen
just as russia is not going to attack the united kingdom there never has been a chance that russia would ever attack either of these two countries but of course the narrative is all to do with power and funneling huge amounts of american taxpayer money into the defense industry and the security industry and these people are both from the class that benefits
its an extremely dangerous game says mr murray and it feeds into a foreign policy that is completely mad
in syria  and i should say im no fan of the assad regime at all  but the idea that backing assorted groups of jihadists to tear the country apart is a better solution is crazy and its especially crazy when weve already messed up iraq afghanistan and now were doing exactly the same thing again and you can see it doesnt work it only works in terms of promoting continued instability and continued spending for the military and the security services
finally murray also believes that the public cant get clear analysis of these issues from mainstream media because they are part of the same moneypower nexus

the obama administration has already voiced criticism over tel avivs expansionist policies considered illegal by the international community

David G. Brown,2016-11-02T23:01:13.657+02:00,feminists attack elderly gay man for saying older women shouldnt wear yoga pants," hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts  hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts bob smith 
bob smith is a man in search of the truth his favorite quotes are were all fools on this earth and i can be no different i know its true i read it at the liebrary and the truth is not misogynistic its just the truth november   culture 
your old uncle bob is mixing things up hereand i think you will see where im going with this new angle of mine pretty quickly i have selected three sjw films to review one from the s one from the s and one of much more recent vintage from  and what might all three of these insidious hollywood movies have in common why they outwardly or subliminally program viewers to blindly adopt bluepill beliefs and behaviors thats what 
i feel unsettlingly dirty just writing about these films but somebodys gotta do it so lets get busy here and expose these three flatout unintentional farces for what they really are seize the day onward and upward or is that downwardin this case in terms of these three horrendously blatant sjw films most definitely downward  to kill a mockingbird   gregory peck robert duvall brock peters mary badham 
this multipleoscarwinning film is based on the pulitzerprizewinning novel of the same name which was written by harper lee and published in and it is that pulitzer prize and those multiple oscars that should be your first major clues that the hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of sjw brainwashing 
this wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the american deep south are vicious stupid ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacksthat is when they arent shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright the plot centers around a hardworking standup straightarrow black man tom robinson brock peters who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving whitetrash slut named mayella ewell collin wilcox whose alcoholic father bob ewell james anderson is a racist pig of unfathomably low character 
the towns sjw lawyer atticus finch gregory peck plays white knight and comes rushing to tom robinsons defensemuch to the dismay of the local good ole boysbut despite his best efforts to free the poor wrongly accused black man finch cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger which ultimately results in the backwater towns killer cops shooting poor tom down in cold blood a familiar theme which can be abundantly found in todays world of dindunothin black folk who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops on an everincreasing and frightening basisyawn gee never heard this one before 
im not even going to get into the rest of this mindnumbing films plot and story line because its a waste of both my time and yours but i will mention a few correlative facts here which you might find just a little bit interesting the sjwcontrolled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released and heres the redpill truth of the matter according to the  annual report on murder by the federal bureau of investigation most interracial murders in the usa involved black assailants and white victims with blacks murdering whites at  times the rate that whites murder blacks 
these stunning disparities began to emerge in the mids when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people an upsurge which not so coincidentally enough corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern sjwcrafted civil rights movement blacks thus committed  times more violent interracial crimes than whites even though the black population was only oneseventh the size of the white population at the time this is according to the survey highlights from  years of surveying crime victims  published in  youll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth 
these days washingtons sjw datagatherers no longer keep track of such  bigoted  statisticsprobably because they care about our safety so very very deeply over the years the cumulative effects have been staggering justice department and fbi statistics indicate that between  and  more than  million violent interracial crimes were committed in the usa overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims and more than  people were killed in interracial murdersthe vast majority of them being blackonwhite killings by comparison  americans died in the vietnam war and  were killed in the korean war 
i wonder how many additional people have been killed in america during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars since  unfortunately we cant get a look at those statistics as previously mentioned because the puppet masters no longer keep such records so far as i can telland if they do they definitely dont want us to see them 
be that as it may the notions set forth in to kill a mockingbird are repulsively twisted morally insidious and patently false and if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review that makes my entire freaking day because in the end all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth and what hollywood dishes out on a regular basis is anything but  gandhi   sir ben kingsley martin sheen candice bergen sir john gielgud 
supposedly as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe mohandas k gandhi played by sir ben kingsley in this multipleoscarwinning film utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against british tyranny on behalf of the indian peoplethe incredibly effective method of nonviolent resistance 
and in the movie gandhi  there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of noncompliant protesters as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks outside of a salt factory the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them 
in reality that was basically all that happened there was a public dogandpony show shortly after this supposedly reallife event which was choreographed by the elitistowned media and indeed in this cleverly constructed movie actor martin sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the usa sheen plays american journalist vince walker in the film 
and what sheens character witnessed and put into words and then passed along to his editor over the phone was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitistowned newspapers as well as on film in elitistowned news reels and marketed all over the worldwhich resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the terrorist acts of the security workers at the salt factory this entire episode was allegedly a key element of indias signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the british 
despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream medias propaganda conduits is either a completely staged event like the indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine imho or something that meshes well with the elites overall master plan or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with  of the worlds major media companies are owned by just six major players we are supposed to believe that the elitistproduced film gandhi  depicts reallife events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth who stood up to the ferocious might of the british empire and brought the entire house down singlehandedly 
please youd have a better chance of talking me into using tinder 
there is another infamous sequence in the film wherein a group of hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest within an enclosed parklike area of the indian city of amritsar the demonstrators are consequently assaulted by british soldiers who open fire brutally and randomly on the assembled sitting ducks and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters this incident allegedly occurred on april   and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over  
and in this single crucial very revealing sequence of the film the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to seeassembling peacefully going against the grain of the established order by utilizing peaceful protest and noncompliance within a group setting is exactly what the elite want the people to do because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them 
in the film after the mass slaughter the soldiers commander is dressed down by his higherups for taking the law into his own hands and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators but that was all done strictly for show and this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer who do you think produced gandhi uh that would be an elitistowned film company columbia picturesdo you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them outuh no way last time i checked rattlesnakes dont commit suicide 
the british empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands and the notion that the stringpullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the british commander who ordered the slaughter at amritsar is comical at best 
what the slaughter at amritsar actually accomplished in addition to the massmurder of a huge swath of ardent protesters was the following 
with the complicit assistance of the elitistowned press the british commanders actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change and throughout history other choreographed events like the slaughter at amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage fueled by the reports in the eliteowned media have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that nonviolent resistance actually works 
which of course it does but only in isolated highprofile choreographed incidents where the outcome has already been decided beforehand whenever the puppet masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheepthe rest of the time it only results in massincarceration physical assault political harassment or murder on a more subtle note you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this oscarwinning film were eventually knighted by the british empirenamely sir ben kingsley knighted in  and sir john gielgud knighted in to which i can only say i rest my case your honor  the gift   jason bateman rebecca hall joel edgerton allison tolman 
i dont typically watch modern hollywood films these days mostly because i know what hollywood is up to so i normally avoid them in the exact same way that i avoid single mothers with tramp stamps or chicks with green hair but i went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on showtime the other night knowing it would probably throw me a wicked sjw curveballand sure enough it didnt disappoint 
as an aside i threw this film into the mix juxtaposed with the previous two oscarwinners partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the hollywood filmmaking industry in terms of the standard of quality they dont even try to hide the sjw brainwashing madness in their films any longer at least back in the day they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way while keeping their overall intentions under the radarbut today as this next film proves not so much 
simon callem jason bateman has a horrifying secret buried in his twisted past and his wife robyn rebecca hall is clueless about the whole thing innocent white female vs evil white male the usual bullshit here the couple relocates from chicago to a suburb of los angeles where they run into gordon gordo moseley joel edgerton a creepy awkward socially inept former high school classmate of simons gordo starts dropping by the couples new house uninvited and unannounced and he does so on far too many occasions simon thinks gordons behavior is weird which it is but his sjw wife thinks gordo is sweet shy and simply misunderstood 
gordos weirdness escalates in typical boremetodeath fashion hollywood is really great at this audiencewowing technique lately until robyn finally discovers her husbands longheld secret he bullied poor gordo back in high school by inventing a story about him which centered around a homosexual relationship that gordo never had the horrendously unfair story got back to gordos father and gordos father nearly killed him 
of course simons liberal sjw brainwashed wife eventually wants her bullyboy husband out of her life forever shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression even though shes pregnant with their first child and they were very much in love up to this point yeah like that would ever happen in real life 
the sjw bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film that youll be left slackjawed stunned and eyerollingly incredulous and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage be sure to keep a barfbucket handy especially for the endingbecause you are definitely going to need it 
hopefully its getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold not only in todays sjw hollywood films but in hollywood films of days gone by most especially oscar winners 
the elite are always using the magic of hollywood for nefarious purposesnamely to magically instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality 
doing this makes it much easier to divide the moviegoing sheep and thereby conquer them typically by race or by historical beliefs or by sociopolitical beliefs 
so do yourself and the world a huge favor and avoid sjw hollywood films wherever and whenever you can the rule is simple if its being made in hollywood today its a bpo film blue pill only and unfortunately as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early s if not even further well as we have just seen the same rule applies in many cases 
by boycotting hollywood films you are lessening the degree of brainwashing to which you subject yourself simply by being alive in the world at the present time and in this particular case less is most definitely more",english,returnofkings.com,No Image URL,hate,1.0,game modern rite passage helps turn boys men,remember signing facebook ten years ago point time new social media site geared mostly toward college students uncommon anyone age account last decade weve seen facebook morph billion conglomerate information kingpin acquiring massive power wealth endless amounts time users waste scrolling news feeds beast social media platform gone consume lives millions gather nefarious amounts data foster unnecessary personal dramas often cause harm good users would prudent take good hard look facebook experience ask something thats actually adding value life five reasons think carefully using worlds largest social media site facebook feed black hole completely worthless information think important create streams information add real value life platforms twitter feedly youtube ive followed writers content producers dedicated lives selfimprovement entrepreneurship higher meaning search truth probably imagine stark difference intellectually curated twitter feed dumbeddown facebook community people went high school peaked th grade log facebook common information youll likely find got married kids got fat scrolling facebook feed akin flipping personalized celebrity gossip magazine grocery store checkout line every time log onto facebook im immediately reminded never log onto facebook longer useful dating college gained value site using chat feature build attraction girls social circle get phone numbers years girls attached creepy stigma guys hit via facebook messenger addition dont really need facebook profile social proof since instagram better social media app meeting girls forfeiture privacy people realized first thing potential employer interviewing look facebook theyre basically searching every reason hire lock account best privacy functions dont let one drunk picture years ago ruin potential job offer wasnt enough facebook long history shady activities comes privacy theyve already caught accessing location without permission speculate else theyve infringing censorship although facebook right control information broadcasted platform doesnt mean abuse right censoring anything might find disagreeable offensive much like overbearing parent facebook proactively controls discourse children eagerly censoring content might rub someone wrong way facebook many overreaches entire website dedicated documenting affronts freedom opinion probably guess side political spectrum try stifle brings worst people plenty time passed indepth research come regarding longterm effects much facebook persons mental wellbeing gives illusion everyone else better life isnt fair slippery slope victim mindset blaming others circumstances oppressed chronic facebook users sip lattes comfy chair starbucks scroll facebook feeds latest macbook wont completely deny merits facebook youre using build brand business could good investment time simply many people actively use ive also witnessed joy brings older users connecting long lost friends havent seen decades truth many cases facebook cause trouble worth never bad idea cut back usage even opt entirely may longer first know upcoming dinner party brad sarah freshman year years suspect might better person read western civilization worth saving,0.0

hillary clinton did a quick presser in iowa to respond to questions about the fbi director james comeys decision to appear to violate the hatch act  by participating in political activities  days before an election 
secretary clinton put pressure on comey to explain himself saying weve heard these rumors we dont know what to believe that is why it is incumbent on the fbi to tell us what they are talking about 
watch here video hillary clinton calls on fbi to release all of the info it has  explain the issue in question without delay httpstcorgurqpf 
 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
the american people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately the director himself has said he doesnt know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not the democratic nominee said 
thats why its incumbent on the fbi to tell us what theyre talking about clinton said 
clinton pushed for more information to be released without delay she said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasnt given advance notice clinton said she had not been contacted by comey on this issue 
when asked what she would tell voters about her emails clinton responded i think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails 
this might be the right place to mention the  million emails the bush administration lost and the private rnc servers they used as context for how important this issue really is to republicans as a value 
kristen welker asked if clinton was afraid that this could sink her campaign to which secretary clinton responded with a big laugh are you worried this could sink your campaign secretary clinton a reporter shouts as hrc walks out clinton only lets out a big laugh 
 ruby cramer rubycramer october   
the republican fbi director james comey wrote the house on friday to inform hopeful republicans that they had found new emails relating to clintons private email that begged further investigation 
it turns out the emails didnt come from clintons server and there doesnt seem to be any there there except for giving republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote 
federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against comey  
hillary clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point how many years on is this republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long its doa the press has followed republicans lead with the absurd email story a story as ridiculous as it is common and a story that was never a story until clinton did it

shawn helton st century wire 
the cozy relationship between goldman sachs and the clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years giving the democratic party nominee hillary clinton an immensely influential partner on wall street 
as the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened fbi probe into the hillary clinton s email server case  the global investment banking firm goldman sachs quietly endorsed the democratic presidential candidate this past week 
the financial ties that bind the clintons and wall street banks like goldman sachs are nothing new but never before have the connections been so exposed lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago 
money changers wall streets goldman sachs are inextricably linked to the clintons and the clinton foundation photo illustration wire 
the clintons  goldman sachs 
while campaigning for his first term in the white house former president bill clinton received an enormous amount of support from washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on wall street 
at the top of the pile sat goldman sachs 
in  the la times reported that presidential nominee bill clinton received the largest share of his financial supportat least  millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists and that clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as goldman sachs  co in new york and stephens inc in his hometown of little rock ark in fact goldman sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm  
for decades the clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth goldman sachs and in the process a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold something that even the ny times admits 
over plus years goldman provided the clintons with some of their most influential advisers millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs 
by now there should be little doubt that the clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the wall street banking cartel their relationship was built over three decades 
the real watershed moment came here 
blank check bill clinton laughs with wall street elites after signing the financial services modernization act in  
key to the kingdom 
in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely 
the clintongoldman sachswall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glasssteagall act  which banking luminaries cynically named the  financial services modernization act of  officially titled the gramm leachbliley act  the original glasssteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the bank act of  that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors  the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression  in fact the grammleachbliley act which repealed glasssteagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked 
simply put clintons repeal of glasssteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking  which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite  which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in  all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really 
in a crossposted article featured at huffington post  nomi prins underscored the complicit nature of wall street and washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the clinton administration during the s 
to grasp the dangers that the big six banks jpmorgan chase citigroup bank of america wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world you need to understand their history in washington starting with the clinton years of the s alliances established then not exclusively with democrats since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital rest assured of one thing their past and present ceos will prove as critical in backing a hillary clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husbands years in office 
prins herself was a former managing director at goldman sachs senior managing director at bear stearns as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm lehman brothers following the financial crash in  prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  it takes a pillage  behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from washington to wall street 
prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the glasssteagall act since departing from the investment banking world 
the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group becoming citigroup which was dubbed the cititravelers act on capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glasssteagall 
then in  in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act  but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glasssteagall would be repealed citigroups cochairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut 
at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal  as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther  in   after  attempts in  years congress passed the financial services modernization act  which led to the repeal of glasssteagall 
the repeal of glasssteagall was pushed heavily by citigroups coceo sanford weill and lobbyist roger levy and according to a report by the nation  
they laid out more than  million for lobbying in  according to the center for responsive politics and donated more than  million in the  election cyclea figure sure to be topped in  
how much of those contributions made their way to the clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the white house 
in  bill clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private goldman events 
in  after stepping down from her position as secretary of state hillary clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at goldman sachs events to the tune of  dollars in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a goldman sachs managing director according to a quote obtained by politico  indeed clinton gave a glowing speech to the goldman gang and in the process as wikileaks released in early october  the democratic nominee believes in both a public and a private position on wall street reform and that it is an  oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis 
that clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics but its only the tip of a much larger iceberg 
in  the washington post reported that hillary rodham clinton and former president bill clinton earned in excess of  million for delivering  speeches since the beginning of  a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid 
anointed chelsea clinton with goldman sachsbacked hedge funder marc mezvinsky 
the clinton family is chockfull of banking connections as chelsea clinton joined the avenue capital group which according to reports is a  billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many democratic party campaigns chelsea is married to marc mezvinsky  a former investment banker for goldman sachs chelseas tenure at avenue capital group was from  just prior to hillary clintons run for president in  since then chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the clinton foundation 
marc mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently eaglevale hellenic opportunity  after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of  million  after blowing the money on secondhand junk greek bank stocks and toxic government debt 
the apple doesnt fall far from the tree 
as it turns out marc is the son of troubled former congressman ed mezvinsky  another close friend of team clinton 
politico reports on one of ed mezvinskys financial controversies in  
in the waning days of clintons presidency federal prosecutors and the fbi were bearing down on former rep ed mezvinsky diowa who had fallen for a series of ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly  million money from other investors to cover his losses  
continuing politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from ed mezvinskys wife to then president bill clinton 
records released last week by the clinton presidential library in little rock and obtained by politico show mezvinsky and his thenwife  exrep marjorie margoliesmezvinsky dpa  pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case 
in  the daily mail reported the following chelsea clintons husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the greek economy and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds marc mezvinsky  and his partners former goldman sachs colleagues bennett grau and mark mallon raised million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation that fund however has lost  percent of its value investors with direct knowledge of the situation told the new york times  and will now be closed

the ny times further outlined the longheld clintongoldman connection just two years before the  financial crisis the clintons relationships with wall street deepened in the s when mr clinton set up his foundation in harlem and mrs clinton was elected to the senate from new york that brought her in close touch with the big wall street firms a source of jobs and tax revenue for new york  and a leading source of campaign funds for mrs clinton during her years in congress employees of goldman donated in excess of  to mrs clinton more than those of any other company except citigroup according to the center for responsive politics along with other new york politicians mrs clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate lower manhattan after the sept   attacks and those breaks helped goldman build its new roughly  billion headquarters when it broke ground in  mrs clinton and other new york officials were onsite how to monetize influence lloyd blankfein at a clinton global initiative event with hillary clinton image source sputniknews  the wall street racket to understand who powers the clinton foundations billion dollar rico influencepeddling slush fund you need to understand how money is laundered between wall street and washington dc goldman sachs jpmorgan chase morgan stanley bank of america and citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the  crash then in april of  goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for  billion dollars cnbc reported the following 
goldman sachs will pay  billion to settle federal and state probes into the banks sale of mortgagebacked securities before the financial crisis the justice department announced monday 
authorities said goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and  crisis the settlement includes a  billion civil penalty  billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and  million to resolve various other claims 
this resolution holds goldman sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail acting associate attorney general stuart delery said in a statement  
in  a bloomberg article questioned how goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the  economic crisis 
whether goldman could have gone the way of lehman brothers or merrill lynch remains the subject of much debate goldman maintains that it did not need or want the  billion bailout that hank paulson  former goldman alum pushed on it and other firms in october  but the fact remains that when the federal reserve allowed goldman and morgan stanleybut not lehman brothersto become bank holding companies on sept   goldman was able three days later to raise  billion in equity  billion from the public and another  billion from investor warren buffett that would probably not have happened without the feds expedited decision and support a week later morgan stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a  billion equity investment from mitsubishi ufj financial group 
all told the clinton friendly investment giant goldman sachs after making record profits became the fifth megabank ordered to pay billions to the department of justice after the financial crash of  in addition the firm was ordered to pay  billion to the federal housing finance agency in   not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the great recession 
in a new york review article goldman sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in  
data gathered mostly from the corporate research project  a public interest website show that on thirteen occasions between  and  goldman was penalized by us courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between  and  
cashing out bill clinton with his top economic strategist robert rubin image source st louis postdispatch  
wall street selects team clinton 
the clinton connection to goldman sachs emerged in the early s as robert rubin  a former senior partner with goldman with a year tenure with the firm joined former president clintons economic policy team later becoming secretary of the treasury in  around that time the clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the rubinomics banner aka clintonomics the plan raised taxes on most americans specifically the middle class  in what was said to be the largest increase in american history at the time 
according to congressional record  vol part   in  the economy grew at a sickly   clintons vetoes of spending cuts insured continued deficits well into the st century 
in a multinational monitor report entitled wall streets best investment ten deregulatory steps to financial meltdown by robert weissman and james donahue  a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the s under the clinton administration was revealed 
during the clinton administration treasury secretary robert rubin who had run goldman sachs enthusiastically promoted the legislation in a  testimony before the house banking committee for example rubin argued that the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago let alone in   us banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically even domestically the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by glasssteagall has eroded significantly 
with a pedigree that included goldman sachs the council on foreign relations cfr the brookings institution and the bilderberg group  robert rubin emerged in  as the vice chairman at citigroup  after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of glasssteagall while serving as secretary of treasury rubin made a fortune with citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the  crash heres a passage from bloomberg regarding rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse 
when it collapsed due in part to bankfriendly policies that rubin advocated he made more than  million while others lost everything you have to view people in a fair light says phil angelides cochair of the financial crisis inquiry commission who credits rubin for much of the clintonera prosperity but on the other side of the ledger are key acts such as the deregulation of derivatives or stopping the commodities futures trading commission from regulating derivatives that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster 
sworn fbi director james comey sworn in by former doj head eric holder image source thewhitehousespin  
under the microscope 
over the summer wire observed some curious connections between the clinton foundation and fbi director james comey  as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the clinton family heres the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the clinton investigation 
many will also be unaware that before comey was installed by the obama administration as fbi director he was on the board of director at hsbc bank  a bank implicated in international money laundering  including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels forbes also points out where comey was also at the key chokepoint during the case involving dodgy auditor kpmg which followed on by the hsbc criminal case 
if comey and his boss attorney general alberto gonzalez had made a different decision about kpmg back in  kpmg would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts hsbc and standard chartered scbff  were committing on its watch bloomberg reported in  that back in june of  comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether kpmg would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations 
in  the guardian discussed the financial relationship between hsbc and the clinton foundation receiving a startling  million in donations from clients of the large bank 
the charitable foundation run by hillary clinton and her family has received as much as m from wealthy international donors who were clients of hsbcs controversial swiss bank 
leaked files from hsbcs swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation with accounts in geneva 
a new update on the fbi investigation into the clinton foundation was announced over the last  hours in addition the recently reopened clinton email probe from last week it remains to be seen how indepth this new investigation will be 
to call it collusion would be an understatement when looking back at the financial affairs of the clintons goldman sachs and others on wall street  its clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate

KD7ONE,2016-10-26T16:45:00.000+03:00,no title,"the above photo was snapped in ferguson as thugs burned the city down could we see a repeat of that fateful event and perhaps a worsening of it soon to a city near you
the election is the focus of every news channel ad nauseum but few people are focused on the day after the election no matter who wins this years presidential selection the possibility of civil unrest the day after election day and beyond is a real possibility are you ready for chaos if it develops
the nation is so divided we are likely to run into problems
the ugliest scenario for the day after election day plays out if trump wins if trump wins get ready for black lives matter the black panthers the race la raza and other racially motivated antiwhite groups to come out and possibly start burning cities down again after all they have been given carte blanche all year long to do so in ferguson baltimore charlotte and san jose  a worrisome precedent has been set
of course trump wont be in power the day after election day we have to wait until inauguration day for him to clean up any potential messes so barack hussein obama is likely to give the racial hate groups the green light once again while the media whips out their collective stradivarius plays my heart bleeds for thee and sympathizes with the devils destroying the nation
if the bitch wins conservative groups may clash with leftists over rights being stripped away
if hillary wins theres the real possibility of protests the day after the election and the social conditioning of whites to be polite and docile even as theyre railroaded in what was formerly their nation may not hold this time around a hillary win means the chaos and possibly violence could wait until she starts stripping constitutional rights away then we are likely to see conservatives finally come out and start raising some righteous hell there could be racially motivated clashes on the horizon as white people standing up for themselves goes against a longestablished narrative that theyre all evil racists
few people think of the effects civil unrest could have on their livelihood and wellbeing its time for a little education on just how thinly stretched the american supply chain is and what could happen with only a shortterm disruption in it
heres a scenario  just one of many possible scenarios video of rioters stopping and then looting a semi tractortrailer in charlotte is worrying because if trucks stop america stops if attacks on truckers happen often enough truckers may decide its not worth the risk to their lives to continue moving freight around and stop driving within a day bedlam could ensue as the supply chain runs on a razors edge in modern america and everything from food to medication to gasoline starts running out
supply chain rioters broke into trucks on i and burned cargo in charlotte
according to the american trucking association ata a disruption of  to  hours means hospitals and nursing homes would run out of food fuel supplies at gas stations would also run out in that time frame garbage would start to pile up most grocery and retail stores would start to run out of food and merchandise atm and bank cash supplies would also run out
the tight rope the corporate system walks quickly breaks when merchandise stops moving
as an example the ata tells us this is what happens during a hurricane imagine what would happen with days or weeks of rioting in major cities
in a hurricane situation supplies that would normally last a few days such as water powdered milk and canned meat typically disappear within one day given these inventory rates this means that perishable goods could be depleted in a matter of days and nonperishables in just a few days runs on food and nonfood staples during hurricanes and even before big winter storms provide a good example of how fast some retail inventories can be depleted during panic buying the same quick depletion of inventories could occur if trucks stopped making deliveries for any reason
panic buying means no food on the shelves when people dont have food at home and then the grocery store doesnt have food rioting will intensify things could get ugly in a hurry as one small disruption leads to a domino effect after which bedlam ensues
so it is best to be prepared with nonperishable items just in case things get out of hand have at least several weeks food supply on hand but how do you stop people from coming and taking your stash
be armed the police wont be around to protect you if bedlam ensues
contrary to gun propaganda from the media  you absolutely want to be armed in the event the election and its aftermath dont pass peacefully what happens when stores no longer have food and gas stations no longer have gas gangs form looking for homes that do have those items
theyre going to pick out the weakest home in the neighborhood and pounce
a home with guns is a safe home just as this youtube video shows  armed thugs may bust into a house looking for money or food but they started jumping through plate glass windows and scrambling like cockroaches once the homeowner came out with guns blazing
several handguns with extra ammunition are advised know how to use them be steady with the trigger and dont be afraid to use them if looters come to your house
the police will not be there to protect you as theyll have their hands full with the chaos
better to be safe than sorry the idea of an intact nuclear family may be a trite memory but protecting your loved ones is still key
with the meltdown of america happening right before our very eyes we are entering an unstable period in the nations history to say the least no matter who wins the election the nation we once knew and loved is passing away trump may be able to turn things around temporarily but even if he does the country now has so many immigrants it will be impossible to assimilate them all
we are entering a period in which america will resemble a third world country more and more the demographics of the nation are being changed on purpose so white people are diminished at the ballot box and democrats will gain a lock grip on the levers of power in the nation in the coming years  divisions between rich and poor will grow and the evil media will be there stirring the pot with racial class and gender division every step of the way  peace will become a thing of the past as squabbling factions compete with each other for dominance
in this transition from prosperity to despotism it is best to be safe than sorry the day after election day will be telling in that it will set the tone for the next four years it may be a somewhat peaceful turn towards communism if the bitch wins or it may not be
but my money is on a steady degradation of civil society in the coming years tend your own garden as i know i will be tending my own my military friends are already discussing what will happen in shtf scenario you should be thinking about it too

EdJenner,2016-11-06T04:10:18.147+02:00,clinton emails use arab female agitators to shame israel," stupid things voxcoms matthew yglesias has said by aaron bandler october   
matt yglesias of vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder given his penchant for saying things that are mindbogglingly asinine apparently yglesias agrees with this sentiment matt yglesias deleted something like  tweets yesterday clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations 
fortunately the internet is forever and all of the stupid things that yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly 
here are  things yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb 
 yglesias was convinced that people would love obamacare that is until he didnt  mattyglesias obamacare marker  which was solid as of  minutes ago  appears to no longer be markering pictwittercomaeyximig  omri ceren cerenomri october   
his  piece is still available though and in it he whines about how supposedly the media for nonideological reasons is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when obamacare becomes the status quo people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten 
in other words yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking that all fell by the wayside when the obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of  percent 
 yglesias made a racist comment toward former louisiana gov bobby jindal r in a  tweet that is now deleted yglesias wrote is bobby jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping 
yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash tweeting oh fun conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode 
eventually yglesias backed down tweeting for the record now that i know more about jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff 
the irony of yglesias saying this was not lost on twitter good thing you dont say dumb stuff mt mattyglesias its clear that jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff  jon gabriel exjon june   
 yglesias once ranted against dumb jewish politicians the leftist pundit wrote a thinkprogress piece in  that was seriously titled dumb jewish politicians in which yglesias highlighted a passage from jonathan chait who wrote in the new republic that thensen joe lieberman ict had to be stupid for not supporting the public option 
i suspect that lieberman is the beneficiary or possibly the victim of a cultural stereotype that jews are smart and good with numbers chait wrote trust me its not true if senator smith from idaho was angering democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes most liberals would deride him as an idiot with lieberman we all suspect its part of a plan i think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn 
yglesias agreed 
ive long held a related theory about eric cantor 
anyways this reminds me that at a meeting this morning i pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret christmas morning session that only jewish senators would attend theres a whole bunch??boxer cardin feingold feinstein franken kohl lautenberg levin lieberman sanders schumer specter and wyden its a very progressive bunch and lieberman could easily be outvoted 
 yglesias advocated for ending time zones seriously in what was a typical example of vox being a waste of space yglesias wrote a  piece titled the case against time zones theyre impractical  outdated yglesias pontificated 
northern idaho is connected via i to spokane and seattle to its west but not to boise to its south so the couer dalene area is on pacific time rather than mountain time india has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time 
yet while these zigzags and minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time they serve a very practical purpose it is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings calls and other arrangements across time zones the need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag commuting across time zones would be more annoying still which is why the suburbs of chicago that are located in indiana use illinois central time rather than indianapolis eastern time 
but the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations its to shift the world to one giant time zone 
ygleasias then called for one time to rule them alla phrase that prompted jrr tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy 
if the whole world used a single gmtbased time schedules would still vary in general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out so at  most of london would be at home or in bed and most of los angeles would be at the office but of course londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in la would be grabbing a nap the difference from today is that if you were putting together a londonla conference call at  thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal a flight that leaves new york at  and lands in paris at  is a sixhour flight with no need to keep track of time zones if your appointment is in el paso at  you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of texas 
pejman yousefzadeh explained just how stupid yglesiass time zone piece was writing at ricochet  i grant you that there are times when confusion does take place but seriously who cares is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that matthew yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them dont the people at vox have anything better to write about 
apparently they dont 
 yglesias doesnt understand floridas geography very well yglesias wrote a short blurb in the atlantic in  in which he began thinking aloud about the city of miami 
id been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know yglesias said 
people immediately pointed the obvious answer miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is the everglades national parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish 
yes yes commenters i know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in florida  hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes an exasperated yglesias wrote in an update 
except that the land is not exswampland its an actual swamp  maybe yglesias shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud 
 yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fineif youre a politician yglesias found himself getting smacked around on twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government 
for better or for worse thats politics yglesias wrote at thinkprogress  
on twitter yglesias attempted to justify it by writing fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do yes 
and yet yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist eli lake of being dishonest on twitter 
yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a catch when he told the daily caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the twitter incident 
 yglesias once hailed the department of veteran affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate the federalist s sean davis pointed to yglesias writing in  that the va was producing the highest quality care in the country their turnaround points the way toward solving americas healthcare crisis yglesias also tweeted at gop chairman reince priebus in  will reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans this tweet was also deleted and for good reason since the va has caused  veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency 
 yglesias doesnt understand the purpose of the senate yglesias wrote the following for thinkprogress in  per the guardian  
if you add together the two republican senators from wyoming with the one from alaska one from south dakota one from new hampshire two from maine two from idaho two from nebraska one from nevada two from utah two from kansas two from mississippi one from iowa two from oklahoma two from kentucky one from louisiana two from south carolina and two from alabama the  of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator  percent of the american population meanwhile barbara boxer and dianne feinstein together represent  percent of the american population 
now of course texas is also a big state though at  percent of the population its a lot smaller than california and there are small states like vermont and north dakota that have two democratic senators so the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one though the wacky apportionment of the senate does have a partisan valence the point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things if you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population we have just  senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain  percent of the population the other  senators represent about  percent of the people if the iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them 
in three paragraphs of rambling incoherent nonsense yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations 
 yglesias doesnt understand americas financial system yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a  slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country as there were  at the time yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous 
 they are poorly managed you know how the best and brightest of wall street royally screw up sometimes this doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys it gets worse and since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from fdicensured depositors nobody is watching the store in effect the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones the dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on wall streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems  they cant be regulated since these banks are so small they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs so since american public policy is perversely committed to preserving them small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations and once the carveouts exist they create pressure for extension further up the food chain other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation  they cant compete if you want the jpmorgan chases and bank of americas of the world to be held to account you need both regulation and competition but a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition having a large share of americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance 
davis debunked yglesiass argument which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in  
yglesias arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks you guys the wall street banks that nearly destroyed america arent the problem small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem dont worry about the facts just go with it davis wrote in the federalist  im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation 
 yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon after reading a review of a booker t washington biography yglesias started thinking about black conservative political tradition prompting him to write in a  thinkprogress post its only extremely recently that the idea of an africanamerican aligning himself à la clarence thomas with the mainstream conservative movement in america could be remotely possible but even so that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist 
this is patently false as damon root explained in reason  
actually the great harlem renaissance author and journalist george schuylerwho was known as the black hl menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before clarence thomas came on the scene including schuylers unambiguously titled  autobiography black and conservative and the celebrated novelist and folklorist zora neale hurston both endorsed conservative sen robert a taft in the  presidential election and repeatedly attacked fdrs new deal 
 yglesias expressed joy when andrew breitbart died following breitbarts death yglesias tweeted  conventions around dead people are ridiculous the world outlook is slightly improved with andrewbrietbart sic dead 
this tweet has also been deleted and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid its ghoulish vile and reprehensible and slate defended yglesias stating that he is a very passionate journalist and slate values that passion 
apparently slate believes that passion trumps basic human decency and a reasonable iq level and yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two

Dr. Majid Rafizadeh,2016-10-27T09:20:34.163+03:00,weird bans on women in iran,"bill clinton inc billions for the foundation  million for the clintons october   
call it the unintended revenge of doug band 
band used to be bills huma the guy that the big guy couldnt go to the bathroom without let alone perform the simplest tasks the clinton foundation was a band project the waters grew murkier but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating doug band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running bill clinton inc 
and band was also organizing personal income directly for clinton under the heading forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc band wrote we have dedicated our selves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
band mentions four such arrangements without naming them bill clinton was paid nearly  million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college laureate international universities according to reports and the familys tax returns a dubaibased firm gems education paid bill clinton more than  in  according to the tax returns band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the clintons including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from ubs ericsson bhp and barclays in  alone according to the clintons tax returns bill clinton earned  in speaking fees 
of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between dougs teneo interests and the entire clintonworld octopus 
we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities band wrote he also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation 
bands memo provided data showing how much money each of teneos  clients at the time had given to the clinton foundation how much they had paid bill clinton and in some cases how he or kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments 
band wrote that teneo partners had raised in excess of  million for the foundation and  million in paid speaking fees for bill clinton he said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out  million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place 
band also described how kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with ubs global wealth management introducing bill clinton to a top executive at a  charity dinner in the ensuing years ubs upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a teneo client and agreed to pay bill clinton for speeches band wrote 
band was actually making the case that the entire network of the clinton foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the clintons not to mention the interests of people around them 
banks and major corporations were doing business with bills toady paying bill money and donating to the clinton foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part 
band described in the memo how he combined his work for cgi and teneo he wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the  cgi gathering to meet with teneo clients he also acknowledged giving free cgi memberships to target teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors memberships generally cost  a year 
teneo meanwhile named bill clinton its honorary chairman clinton had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to teneo regarding geopolitical economic and social trends according to a separate june  memo that band wrote to the state department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment 
bill clinton was initially paid  million by teneo according to man of the world a book written with the former presidents participation by author joe conason 
and heres where it gets appropriately entertaining 
but band outlined that kelly his teneo cofounder had served simultaneously between  and  as an unpaid economic envoy to northern ireland appointed by thensecretary of state hillary clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included coke ubs and dow band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with kellys state department ethics agreement 
kellys multiple roles came together during one state department event in  when thensecretary clinton recognized dow among other companies for creating jobs in northern ireland and thanked kelly for his work on the issue 
dow became one of teneos first major clients according to bands memo dow chief executive andrew liveris had been introduced to bill clinton over a round of golf with kelly in august  
thats not consistent with mafia ethics agreements but its all good in clintonworld",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/hillary-hijab_3.jpg?itok=hUc_tXHO,hate,1.0,obama used religious test

Jason Easley,2016-10-26T23:38:10.835+03:00,clinton isnt letting up as she hammers trump for pimping his hotel instead of campaigning,"a pollster who is in the field in two swing states is reporting that he is seeing no early impact from the fbi reviewing new emails in the hillary clinton investigation in two swing states 
geoff garin of hart research tweeted from the field still early but i was in the field in two states last night and saw absolutely no impact from the reporting on the comey letter 
 geoff garin geoffgarin october   
it is still early but if this were the election shifting news that republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate the reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign it will be because republicans are coming back to trump 
there are few undecided voters in this election and even if all the republican base come home to trump it wont be enough for trump to win because he is losing where the presidential election is really held trump is getting crushed at the state level 
republicans have been trying to build hillary clintons emails into a story for years and they have failed at every turn 
hillary clinton led the election while under congressional investigation hillary clinton led the election while under fbi investigation hillary clinton is leading the election today the message that republicans and the media dont want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails and they dont care 
voters are smarter than republicans and the press give them credit for the hillary clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that clinton did anything wrong 
if the polls tighten a little this will be the best news in the world for hillary clinton and democrats because it will destroy any potential for democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls

Alex Ansary,2016-11-05T00:33:12.210+02:00,bill clinton and hillary lolita express pedophilia ring,"opinion hillary is the whore of babylon and is not human  
tracy twyman 
i put some of this information in an article i published yesterday morning about a larger subject today i have decided to isolate these segments and add more for a comprehensive piece on the subject because other relevant information has emerged 
people in the fbi think hillary clinton is the antichrist  they are close she is the whore of babylon 
hillary was born in  supposedly i looked for this information on a hunch after noticing several clues and sure enough back in  someone on david ickes forum speculated that hillary may have been the moonchild that according to artist marjorie cameron  was implanted into her own womb by rocket scientist occultist and crowley associate jack parsons during a ritual called the  babalon working  the purpose was to birth a child to be an incarnation of what crowley called  babalon  the scarlet whore with the cup of blood foretold in st johns revelation that rides the beast 
cameron actually claimed that this fetus after being taken from her womb was delivered to people involved in the militarys nuclear weapons progranm who were apparently in cahoots with parsons and placed inside of a nuclear bomb that was tested but the fetus survived she said because it had been placed inside of a special canister made exactly for this purpose for the  trinity bomb test they made a special canister called jumbo that was supposed to to preserve the plutonium if the bomb did failed to go off they reportedly didnt end up using it for that but it has been suggested that this is what preserved the fetus of the moonchild presumably it grew up to be somebody 
crowley named one of his female consorts who he always called his scarlet women hilarion her name was jeanne foster crowleys attempt to conceive an heir as a magical child with hilarion resulted supposedly in the childs spirit being attached to his protege charles stanfield jones back in  the attachment allegedly occurred when jones went through the ritual for crossing the abyss in the th degree of the oto which involves being ritually sodomized by everyone in the group 
jack parsons another person who had willingly subjected himself to this ritual channeled the book of the antichrist in  where he foretold 
and within seven years of this time babalon the scarlet woman hilarion will manifest among ye and bring this my work to its fruition 
i also believe that hillary with her notorious cracking voice and possibly her rival trump were foretold in another document channeled by parsons the book of babalon  
her voice is sure as the judgement trump to crack the house of wrong though walls are high and stone is hard and the rule of hell was long the gates shall fall and the irons break in the birth of babalon 
in rome the hilaria was a festival to the goddess cybele worshipped in the form of a black meteorite stone to celebrate the resurrection of her son who as the legend states she had been having sex with she then became jealous of his love of others castrated him and let him die of bleeding the reason why all of her priests the galli were castrated and actually considered women she later regretted this and caused him to be brought back to life then forced everyone under her rule to celebrate by laughing and partying joyously as commemorated in this festival consider this next time you notice hillary clinton laughing inappropriately 
also note that hillary clinton has made several selfdepricating jokes about herself being  not even human  and shortcircuiting when she gets herself twisted up in her own lies specifically in october  when her interviewer at buzzfeed noted that she seemed to not be sweating even though it was a hot day odd because hillary has notoriously bad bo she asked hillary what kind of deodorant she used clintons reply was astounding

Mike Rivero,2016-11-08T02:09:00.000+02:00,how to report voter fraud  crash course,"print sidebyside of bill clinton and danney williams 
new york youtube on wednesday suspended the account of danney williams the yearold who has claimed since the s to be the black son of former president bill clinton 
youtube citing repeated or severe violations of our terms of use andor community guidelines declared the account cannot be restored 
the youtube decision blocked the nineminute feature banished  the untold story of danney williams which had received  million views since williams posted it last week produced by filmmaker joel gilbert it drew nearly  views per day and more than  viewer comments with the overwhelming majority expressing support for williams and outrage at the clintons for not being willing to allow a dna test to determine paternity 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
my youtube account has been deleted but the same video appears in  other places on youtube alone williams said on his facebook page after being notified of youtubes decision youtube cant handle the truth please share billclintonson 
twitter also continues to allow williams to post the banished video on danney williams page  but the twitter link to youtube displays the message  this video is no longer available because the youtube account associated with this video has been terminated sorry about that 
the video is still running on danney williamsclintons facebook page  as well as on the youtube channel operated by gilbert 
attempt to silence danney williams 
gilbert told wnd he helped williams file an online appeal form on youtube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated 
the behavior of youtubegoogle in suspending danneys account is outrageous there have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any youtube terms or guidelines gilbert said 
gilbert was outspoken in charging youtube with partisan political motives for the suspension 
the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danney to run him off the plantation as danney said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  gilbert said 
danney cannot be silenced any longer he continued hillary may try to sweep danney williams under the rug but its not going to work this time his story is out there and every day more and more people understand bill and hillary clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin 
see the danney williams video feature 
wnd reported oct  that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate attorneys for williams were in las vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding dna evidence from the former president 
accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating williams that went viral on the internet 
no definitive dna test 
wnd reported that no dna test was conducted in  despite media reports to the contrary when williams claim first surfaced 
clinton defenders since  have contended the tabloid star magazine conducted a dna showdown proving bill clinton was not williams father citing star magazine editor phil bunton saying at the time there was no match nothing even close 
but in an interview bunton told wnd that no blood sample was obtained from clinton and star magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test 
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna bunton told wnd 
bunton is now the owner of the rivertown magazine in haverstraw new york 
he affirmed to wnd that the tabloid relied on the dna evidence for clinton published by independent counsel kenneth starr extracted from the infamous monica lewinsky blue dress 
we got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media including the new york times wanting to know when we were going to get the dna back bunton recalled to wnd we thought it was going to turn out to be his son but when the dna came back there was no story there even to write 
the dna test released by kenneth starr was the second of two dna laboratory tests the fbi had run on clinton but the public record leaves no doubt that starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the fbi 
twitter rules 
many other figures who have challenged the democratic party or the leftleaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets including james okeefe and his project veritas which has exposed clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hiddencamera videos just as okeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud oct  twitter shut down his account  claiming violations of twitter rules the notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules which prohibit harassing other users threatening other users disclosing other users private information or violating other rules in a statement okeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public on monday okeefe wrote in a tweet project veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to youtube calling the apparent block bizarre earlier this month okeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a hillary clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day his account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hiddencamera video that exposed a clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns the daily caller reported  project veritas posted an undercover video oct  proving hillary clinton supporters were inciting violence at donald trump rallies to gain negative media coverage millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours but it didnt show up on googles trending list on youtube which google owns noted silenceisconsentnet  it did however trend on twitter which google does not own breitbart blogger milo yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by twitter minutes before his gays for trump party at the republican national convention for some  months the makers of the new movie im not ashamed about the first victim of the columbine killers in colorado in  were unable to promote their movie through youtube the trailer was taken down late in  and the movies entire channel was suspended

if thats not getting out the vote we dont know what is its definitely easy to come up with a million excuses to avoid the polls but once candices ovaries had shot out of her body they werent going to retract back inside until she had done her civic duty 
while it might have been a bit of an inconvenience to spend the morning voting no matter how much she tried to resist candices ovaries kept pulling and clawing at the floor dragging her flailing body farther and farther until she arrived at a voting booth to cast her vote sure she would rather have been sleeping or at work but three miles and several forceful tugs later she was inside a voting booth and back on her feet casting her ballot and exercising her fundamental american right

USA Today,2016-10-26T23:45:15.782+03:00,california national guard members wont have to pay back bonuses,"will china trigger the next global recession current debt level causes grave concern jing jin  misesorg   
chinas debt growth rate has become the focus of some discussions and fair enough from comparing the outright levels it may seem that china can collapse at any moment 
daniel fernandez suggested this in his article  has china reached its debt limit  in mises wire  in response to the governments monetary expansion stimulus plan after the  financial crisis chinas corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector however in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective using the same data source as used by fernandez we find that chinas total debt as a percentage of gdp was  percent by the end of  debttogdp ratio of corporate government and household sectors stood at  percent  percent and  percent respectively 
for government and household sectors both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a fourtrillion yuan rmb stimulus plan in  government debttogdp ratio which was kept in the mid s in the first decade of this millennium now stood at  percent by the end of  households debttogdp ratio was at  percent in  and almost doubled to  percent in  and then doubled again to  percent by the end of  the leveraging up of households happened exactly as the chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its  stimulus 
apart from the demand for urban housing chinese households with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation furthermore as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending household debt increased dramatically however we must note that although the debt growth rate was high the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers 
the most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector with the debttogdp ratio increased from approximately  percent prior to  to  percent by the end of  first of all the level of corporate debt mostly in the form of bank loans was high to start with but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector whose funding source is mostly deposits two figures from jonathan andersons how to think about china series provide some insights  
an international comparison of assets of banking system vs domestic saving rate 
breakdown of assets of chinas financial system 
this point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures for example between the us and china obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in china whereas in the us the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily 
financial asset structure us vs china  
data source the world bank federal reserve bank shanghai stock exchange shenzhen stock exchange china central deposit and clearing co ltd ccdc sifma 
it is therefore not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to governments stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system chinas flat yield curve 
the large role of the banks can also be seen in chinas bond market yields and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve  the reason for this is simple deposits when banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields this investment strategy or assetliability management scheme bids up the bond prices on the long end hence pushing down the longterm yields 
in addition between allocating deposits to these two types of assets bonds vs loans banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds rather than lending due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand credit risks market liquidity and yields that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early  so the yield spread at current stage reflects more of the combination of chinas financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals as the government flooded the market with four trillion rmb from the stimulus plan in  bond yields faced downward pressure more so at the longterm end please see the yields of chinese government treasury bonds at maturity  years vs  year and the spread thereof in the below figure wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of bankingsector supervision in form of trusts for example but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner 
data source wind ccdc 
china didnt open up to the outside world until the very late s now china provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around  percent obviously a good part of chinas production structure has been configured to export mostly to the developed economies which are dominated by the service sector as the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum china faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers which stands at  times the number of us consumers this reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities but to me this is more of a textbook case of austrian economics at work capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market and this takes time moreover quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than  years ago so that chinese consumers dont have to go to japan to buy hitech toilet lids  a healthier skepticism of stimulus 
needless to say the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue ultimately whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post  stimulus phase is a function of how fast the chinese government runs the money printing press a recent article on the peoples daily  the mouthpiece of china communist party ccp  quoted the diagnosis from an authoritative figure on the chinese economy and its cure this authoritative figure suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate comparing with its own historical average of  percent anyone with an understanding of chinas political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of chinese leadership this can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years 
the xinhua news agency the mainstream media group recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world how chinas policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media in addition a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced and the central government is pushing hard for businessfriendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom 
china has its problems tons of them china may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises as many people say no matter whichever the case i am more convinced that china will be among the first ones to revive  because it has high savings to invest it has a welltrained labor force with one of the most vibrant if not the most complete manufacturing chain and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over  percent of its gdp it is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process it is not yet a welfare state chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises china has the biggest potential market of  billion people with a rising middleclass that is still increasing in numbers and share in population serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the st century

a trump supporter sporting a hillary for prison tshirt chanted jews sa in support of his candidate during a rally in arizona on saturday 
the target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for trumps rhetoric at every rally 
the context while the crowd was chanting usa one man chanted jews sa words like that cant be spun or read into the intent and meaning were obvious to everyone 
watch here on video obtained by the huffington post  
this sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that donald trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction it may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which trump has shown contempt but it is not 
muslims jews immigrants labor taxpayers latinos hispanics mexicans africanamericans women pows veterans people with disabilities gold star families and the military have felt the sting of trumps words and the disdain in his heart 
throughout this campaign season the vitriol against hillary clinton saw no limit signs and tshirts too disgusting to quote in this article chants of lock her up at the republican convention and since trump promised his base of thugs lowlifes and haters he would weaken the first amendment strengthen the second and establish the altright utopia 
hillary clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race she also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar she was competing for who we are and who we could be for all the trump claims that the media is rigged in clintons favor it was trump who got free advertising who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary news stories of the campaign 
there is no doubt that hillary clinton will keep her promise to fight for us she has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign every time hillary clinton called out donald trumps sexist comments she was fighting for all women who were attacked humiliated and sexually abused by men like trump every time clinton shamed trumps horrific and disgusting comments about the khan family she was standing up for every gold star family she was also standing up for every muslimamerican the same is true every time clinton condemned trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to altright stereotypes about africanamericans innercities and africanamerican communities 
every time trump spewed hate in whatever direction hillary clinton defended the target 
so no this isnt about choosing the lesser of two evils like every election this is about choosing our next president more importantly its about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be

the united arab emirates a key saudi ally in its deadly aggression against yemen has welcomed a new united nations peace proposal to end the yemen conflict 
the uae supports the efforts of un special envoy for yemen ismail ould cheikh ahmed knowing that the mission of a mediator is always tough minister of state for foreign affairs anwar gargash said on his twitter account on thursday 
the remarks came two days after the un envoy submitted the plan to yemens houthi ansarullah movement and its allies 
according to informed sources the roadmap urges agreement on naming a new vice president after the withdrawal of houthis from the capital sanaa and other cities and their handover of arms to a third party 
the initiative further calls on former yemeni president abd rabbuh mansur hadi to transfer power to the vice president who would appoint a new premier to form a government united nations special envoy for yemen ismail ould cheikh ahmed speaks to reporters at sanaa airport following his visit to the yemeni capital on october   photo by reuters 
the roadmap represents a political solution for the yemeni crisis gargash said adding un efforts represent a chance to bring yemenis back to the political track other alternatives are gloomy 
the hadi administration however said that it had not received any roadmap for a political settlement 
peace talks which were held between yemens opposing parties in kuwait ended in deadlock in august 
earlier this week ahmed made a visit to sanaa where he held meetings with yemens warring sides and called for a return to a cessation of hostilities to allow aid deliveries 
the riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on yemen on sunday hours after a threeday truce in the conflictridden country expired 
yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by saudi arabia since late march  with the un putting the toll from the aggression at more than  
the offensive was launched to crush the houthi ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former yemeni government

Bob Smith,2016-11-12T01:10:16.836+02:00,two more hollywood films for men that leave todays sjw movies in the dust,"leave a reply mike adams  under fbi head james comey who has deliberately and clearly conspired to cover up the enormous number of crimes committed by hillary clinton and her closest staffers the fbis investigation of additional emails is now concluded we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton comey announced today 
with this decision james comey essentially announces that the tyranny of criminal government in washington is now complete  
the rule of law has just been declared null and void by the head of the fbi no sufficiently powerful person in washington will ever be held accountable for their crimes including crimes of treason against the nation bribery corruption destruction of evidence and selling government influence 
unless something reverses very quickly the fbi has now cemented its position as nothing more than a corrupt branch of a totalitarian criminal regime that has seized power in washington to protect the criminal class of political elitists who rule over the nation as lawless tyrants 
now its up to rogue fbi agents or the nypd to go public with the evidence they have and expose the horrifying truth about what the clintons really are pedophilia and all if that fails my analysis says we may see a rapid ramping up of real talk of open revolt  perhaps even leading to an armed citizens march on washington to depose the criminal regime in power as ive pointed out before that effort would only require a few thousand armed citizens to achieve the occupation of key government buildings and the overthrow of the criminals in power sadly it would also involve tremendous bloodshed and loss of life lets hope it doesnt come to that 
heres the letter james comey sent out today i write to supplement my october   letter that notified you the fbi would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former secretary of state clintons use of a personal email server since my letter the fbi investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation during that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from hillary clinton while she was secretary of state based on our review we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton i am very grateful to the professionals at the fbi for doing an extraordinary amount f highquality work in a short period of time source uk daily mail  sf source natural news",english,returnofkings.com,No Image URL,hate,1.0,absolutely worth learn game,one seans powerful videos definitely worth minutes takes listen g grannum sf source sgtreportcom nov share,0.0

and place a mafia criminal into power at the highest level of government through the deliberate pursuit of journalistic malpractice  seditious clinton operatives must be arrested and put behind bars to protect america we the people are beyond the stage of merely wanting to vote you out of power and turn off your broadcast networks its now time to seek your indictment and imprisonment so that you cannot be allowed to harm this society ever againevery operative journalist and coconspirator with the clinton foundation the clinton corruption and the clinton murders must be arrested indicted and if found guilty by a fair trial sent to prison this nation needs to heal itself from the clinton nightmare  and the only way thats going to happen is if the criminal traitors sellouts and corrupt

empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that god forbid we put someone like that in the white house he added of clintonkallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureauthe agents are furious with whats going on i know that for a fact he said corrupt proclinton journalists should not be given any quarter in all this much like the propagandists of the third reich they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the american people did you know that hillary clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her clinton foundation if you arent aware of this you need to watch clinton cash immediately  the simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel what america has now come to realize via the wikileaks email dumps  the project veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former fbi agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel from the dnc which actively conspired to sideline bernie sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false smear attacks against donald trump every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt democrat political operatives abide by no laws no ethics and no boundaries they lie cheat and steal their way into power at every election and theyre desperately trying to steal this election tooits not just that the clinton crime family must be taken down you see its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned  there isnt a highlevel operative inside the dnc who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis the coordination and collusion money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists todayevery one of these people needs to be arrested indicted and imprisoned this is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across america aside from their criminality democrats policy ideas just dont work even on policy alone democrats are total failures  none of their ideas or policies actually work look at obamacare with its insurance costs now doubling every  years  with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding this was hailed as an historic solution by obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through congress and the supreme court in reality obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis and i called it that from its inceptiondemocrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail they confiscate money from taxpayers waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up while siphoning off billions for their own salaries bonuses and luxurious lifestyles then if you oppose their complete idiocy they invoke the irs to have you audited or arrested this is amerika today under obama and the clintonsthis racket must end the clintons and all their coconspirators must be sent to prison donald trump is right when he says this is bigger than watergate theres no comparison the crimes of the clintons are a thousand times larger and more damning to democracy than anything richard nixon ever attempted corrupt leftist media still lying every hour in a desperate attempt to defeat trump while all this is happening the corrupt leftist media  washington post new york times msnbc cnn google news yahoo news etc  has long since abandoned any pretense of engaging in journalism and is now allin for the clinton criminal mafiathey have

election we the people will take to the streets and take our democracy back  we the people will not accept a clinton presidency under these conditions of massive fraud collusion and extreme media bias based on everything we are seeing right now there is no scenario under which hillary clinton will be accepted as the legitimate victor of this election in no way has this been an open fair and free

the failed corrupt political establishment run by sinister criminals who belong behind barsget ready my friends to take this country back first vote for donald trump as a vote against corruption and collusion of the leftist establishmentsecondly demand the arrest of all clintonlinked operatives  including those in the leftist lying mediathirdly do not tolerate the theft of your democracy by

stupid to parse a sentence defeat clinton now or lose america to a totalitarian regime that will never let go of absolute power this is your last chance to take america back if you allow the clintons

Letsbereal,2016-10-26T17:20:00.000+03:00,nintendo cuts fullyear sales operating profit forecasts,"by day i work in a scrap yard it is not glamorous but glamour does not pay my bills in the evening i teach in a welding program at a community college
like many others i once bought into the fallacy that you need a piece of paper from a university to succeed in life at the age of thirty i graduated from a university with an undergraduate degree and the customary debt which came along with it twentynine years later i see how wrong i was
soon after graduating i obtained an office job and moved to a city where i knew no one the job i was so optimistic about turned out to be like marriage to a crack whore each day was as if walking through a minefield full of dysfunctional women emasculated men drama backstabbing catfights and every other problem associated with modern workplaces worse yet the cut male managers allowed trim to be in charge resulting in a fucked up toxic culture after three tumultuous and abusive years i found myself unceremoniously kicked to the curb and surprisingly relieved
after a lengthy stint of unemployment i landed an entrylevel job in a metal fabrication company one of the benefits offered was tuition reimbursement for work related classes i enrolled in welding classes at night and upgraded my skills all on my employers dime
i immediately noticed a difference from my previous job i worked exclusively with men except for a few token assholes the men liked their solitude did their jobs and left each other alone the work was varied creative and with overtime the pay was decent the fact that i had a work ethic showed up every day on time and desired to learn earned me respect quickly
i eventually went down a different path but returned to welding parttime as an adjunct instructor
welding is the joining of two metal pieces or parts by applying heat a filler metal or electrode helps to make the joint power source supplies electricity required for heat and a shielding gas or fluxcovered electrode aids in the welding process
the most common welding processes are gas metal arc welding gmaw flux core arc welding fcaw gas tungsten arc welding gtaw and shielded metal arc welding smaw of these gas metal arc welding is the easiest to learn and offers the fastest production welding involves both ferrous steel and nonferrous metals aluminum stainless steel
why welding  according to a bureau of labor report the need for welders will grow by  percent by 
 according to a national association of manufacturers report nearly  percent of manufacturers in the united states report that they cannot find skilled welders to meet demand
 the american welding society reports that the average age for a welder is now in the midfifties
 entrylevel wages in my region average  annually with skilled welders earning  and more after five years in the trade
i frequently hear from employers who are desperate for skilled welders one plant manager told me there are too many computer jockeys and not enough people who can weld and turn a wrench another manufacturer told me we have over a dozen welders retiring and no one to replace them further the school i teach at has more jobs available than they have students enrolled
what welders do welders work in manufacturing construction maintenance repair facilities and service companies welders typically work eighthour shifts and a fiveday week but overtime is common welders often perform other duties like operating metal fabrication equipment and doing assembly work
the more skills a welder develops the more value and earning potential he has for example being able to weld cut and fit up metals and read weld symbols and prints will command a higher wage becoming certified in certain weld procedures also increases a welders wages and marketability
qualifications 
welding is the quintessential bluecollar job it is physically demanding hot dirty and requires a high degree of skill other personal characteristics are good eyesight and hand eye coordination good manual dexterity and good concentration
training community colleges offer affordable training for entrylevel jobs in welding most programs are nine months but my school also offers a sixteenweek work ready certificate in welding students learn common welding processes thermal cutting processes and blueprint reading unlike the typical ivory palace college professors instructors are required to have a minimum of three years related and verifiable industrial experience job placement is also good
additional facts 
despite a decent paying skill in high demand clueless parents and educators continue to dissuade young men from entering bluecollar trades like welding the result has been an entire generation of young men ruined by hostile fouryear colleges worthless degrees and insurmountable debt
perhaps you are a perceptive and bright young rok reader considering a career change in closing consider these facts
 you will always have employment as a welder
 welding skills are highly transferable you can carry these skills to your next and often higher paying job
 unlike many whitecollar corporate jobs of today the average welders wages increase with skill overtime merit increases and production bonuses are common benefits for welders
 at the end of your shift you can leave your job at the door
 welding offers a level of creativity solitude and seeing the fruits of your labor studies show that welders machinists and other bluecollar trades have lower suicide rates than many whitecollar professions
 welding is often a gateway trade into other even higher paying trades like machinist multicraft machinery maintenance and millwright
 welding is a male dominated occupation traditionalist men will find it offers some insulation and respite from the typical feminist diatribe and pc bullshit of todays corporate world
conclusion how has welding benefited me first i developed reasoning skills something that academia failed to do i also developed a thorough understanding of how men do the dirty nasty and dangerous jobs in this life feminists and elitists can marginalize men all they want but men risk their lives and health to build and maintain their shit
further welding has opened some doors for me mainly teaching my ultimate goal is to teach welding fulltime a late life career change if you will and one i hope will happen

today is february   and youre one month closer to death what have you done this year to improve yourself some may say new years resolutions are copouts for actually setting reasonable goals instead of starting today we say in a week ill hit the gym and finally get ripped i like the idea of coming up with goals and plans to achieve them for january st of the next year the start of each year is a mental rebirth january  is a new snow begging for you to make fresh tracks in it a blank canvas yearning to be painted on 
however many do use new years resolutions to feel better about themselves they gorge themselves on baked goods drink heartily and fail to exercise throughout the month of december telling themselves that next year will be different and just one last time before i change this is not the case for us here at return of kings we are different  writers readers and commenters all strive to build themselves into the man they want to be 
personally i had some slipups through the month of january but what sets the determined apart from the shambling masses is that we pick ourselves up and keep pushing forward one step at a time  i started the year off strong my days and nights booked full with dates time with girlfriends reconnecting with old friends i eschewed online dating and become more social during the day time i broke prs on all of my lifts dropped a few pounds and sought coaching for the olympic lifts 
most importantly i held myself accountable for all of my actions if i ate too much drank too much or didnt take opportunities i should have i picked myself up and adapted push forward and give everything you have how bad do you want it what happens when you reach your goal do you aim higher or do you stop there and remain content with being slightly above average  if you choose the latter and have finite concrete goals you are already anticipating the day you can quit building yourself youre doomed for failuredont ever miss an opportunity to get better  take risks  analyze your successesfailures and dont stop until youve surpassed your goals then strive to be better faster and stronger 
what are your goals for  are they smart  do you have a purpose  do you want to have sex with more beautiful women learn a language  lift more weight and make more money do you have an accountability buddy or do you journal and meticulously track your progress

David G. Brown,2016-10-28T19:52:54.756+03:00,ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women,"why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society 
andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   culture 
the existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever many are those who contend for public attention credibility and money as a reward for their wits not to mention the very status of intellectual yet the existence of such people is far from selfevident for centuries traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years 
so as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the empire of nothinga necessary step if we want a lasting victoryan important question must be confronted do we need at all what has been called intellectuals during last centuries and if we do not what should we have instead the origin of modern intellectuals 
at the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis before it western europe was united by the same christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economysubordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer 
when modernity reared its philosophical head through rené descartes a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century the old continent was in a much more problematic state christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core we have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence but in fact thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression 
the irish bishop george berkeley  criticized how the practice of philosophy had become on his age synonymous with getting embroiled into thousand scruples prejudices and errors of sense a situation he attributed to the wrong use we make of our faculties likewise the scottish philosopher david hume  scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the systems of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene that is a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything 
there is nothing which is not the subject of debate and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions the most trivial question escapes not our controversy and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision disputes are multiplied as if everything was uncertain and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth as if everything was certain amidst all this bustle it is not reason which carries the prize but eloquence from hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds 
the first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis descartes berkeley hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies but soon the very controversy became an institution a whole market of ideas was growing in which more and more lettrés started to see an opportunity to make a name thus earning fame social standing and sometimes money hume could not help himself soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others systems while promoting their own he was doing the same 
such was the socalled enlightenment the further undermining of any spiritual philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety they would be experts at flattering the powerful mocking the catholic church fiddle fashionable themes and witty prose and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a progress the very expression enlightenment stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity the intellectuals bread and butter 
it can be noted that from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century generations of scientists have sprang up some of these characters were mathematicians engineers doctors or dedicated observers of nature and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter  but make no mistake even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research thus following a headlong rush dynamic at its side the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them 
the momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern west where god ceased to speak the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress it doesnt matter if problems are genuine or artificial intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron 
two typical intellectual characters are voltaire and émile zola both were gifted writers both were charming and witty both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves not so incidentally both were french and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism 
voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were protestants inside a catholic country the infamous affaire calas  from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society stirring the public opinion pressuring magistrates until the fatherwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigationwas rehabilitated two centuries and a half later young frenchmen are still taught voltaire was a champion of truth justice and reason whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence 
zola more than a century later did the same a jewishfrench captain alfred dreyfus  was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to prussia years later some new evidence seemed to indicate that dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents at this very moment zola published an incendiary article jaccuse  where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire  eventually dreyfus was rehabilitatedand the army the patriots and the catholics were shamed through a neverending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story 
voltaire and zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind we are taught about a situation of injustice where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions fortunately a heroic talking head rises miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as oppressors and the poor victims rehabilitation is also the victory of reason justice and progress 
thus the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion provided they follow a mysterious sense of history there have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside whos gonna pay 
even if you are gifted with words and language being a talking head does not pay much would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion no matter how elaborate on anything the problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots voltaire was close from wealthy protestants bankers one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in geneva and zola was a rotschild protégé  both of them contributed to tarnish catholicism and most of their own people in other words they served interests that could pay themthey were sellouts 
today some bloggers happen to earn money as independents especially when they found themselves a niche yet independence is scarce way too many people would like to live from their wits and even more obtain recognition as intellectuals more than often intellectual types turn into teachers journalists or even marketersthus depending upon an institution that pays them 
in north america the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized  whether in the academic or in the media you wont easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural marxism and in case you wouldnt be selfhating enough they are already replacing you with minority individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily 
old marxism was wellaligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class not as individuals it handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of progress keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated state where modelobsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status money and moral recognition 
but the whole marxist vocabulary of progress and emancipation dissimulated what seems glaring today namely that intellectuals were recognized and paid not because they were enlightened or bright but because they were an efficient tool of destruction 
the conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types the average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite such a lack pushed a number of high iqs to the arms of the left who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism antiwhiteness antimasculinity pathological altruism transgender madness politically correct repression and so on intellectuals were never paid to say the truth they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function 
if we happen to beat cultural marxism what shall we do with intellectual types if we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies we have to think about what we will replace the bobo leftist establishment the intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution a truly traditional society would likely have initiates something akin to high priests and knights in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers how exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question conclusion 
the french essayist alain soral once famously said a journalist is either a whore or without a job this is even truer for most intellectuals sold as they are to a destructive left or more seldomly to the inefficient right 
culture is overrated what the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix full of lies taboos and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit no wonder why the shrewd robert greene advised to be an intense realist one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream culture 
the previous generations could join the cultural marxist establishment and pretend their destructive egoladen works were progress to our generation this is impossible either we stand up for our very existence even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death before we take the power back a shared awareness must be stimulated and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the wellfunded antiwhite antimasculine establishment types whom we must beat on their own field once and for all bonus  quotes about the intellectuels 
some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning modern philosophy features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints these issues only exist because they are poorly framed they have no fundamental reason to exist in many cases defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear plain and simple if modern philosophy did not strive to maintain them because it makes a living out of ambiguity  rené guénon introduction to the study of the hindu doctrines  chap rené guénon young 
philosophers care much more about putting forth problems no matter how artificial and illusory than about solving them they also strive to link their name to a system that is to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work hence the desire to be original at any price even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality a philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others rené guénon the crisis of the modern world  chap rené guénon older 
the most evident feature of modern critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant in appearing original from the point of view of those who embody this intellectuality the catchy line the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others have a much greater value than truth ideas when they use them are nothing but a pretext what matters is to look intelligentjust as to the mainstream politician the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career the vanity fair the most deleterious subjectivism often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism are essential components of this phenomenon the critique is a scourge of modern culture an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture in normal traditional civilizations one could find creators artists and those who would judge the works without intermediaries the sovereigns the patrons and the people our times have witnessed the appearance between the public and the creators that cultural pimp that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a critique  julius evola the bow and the club baron giulio cesare evola 
show me more venal more insensitive more corrupt minds than those of the literate caste how many of them do you know whose virtue would still be uncorrupted who but them for over thirty years kept flooding us with a loosened morale a disdain for work a disgust of duty a disrespect for family who but the literary who dipped into secret funds more shamelessly than they did who seduced women softened the young excited the nation to more debauchery than they did who did abandon cowardly the princes after begging for their favours socalled men of letters always they run like harlots between the legitimate government and usurpers between monarchy and republic between politics and socialism between atheism and religion everything is good to them as long as they can make a profit and be fashionable out of it  pierrejoseph proudhon quoted by the following one pierrejoseph proudon 
compare for example seventeenth century writers with those of the eighteenth what a difference in tone and gait the former under a veneer of servility have the most noble and proud stance they do not pretend to reign they merely stand at their place recognize the place of a superior power beyond give themselves completely to their writing task dismiss the temptation of advertising and demonstrate their professional dedication on the other hand look at the voltaire diderot and the like they open well the era of intellectuals writing stooges as they are courtiers of princes they flatter and despise at the same timesomething they are forced to do as they want to usurp their power their courtier nature reveals in everything they do the whole eighteenth century both spiritual and plain on a scoundrel background is libertine and already pornographic such is the start of literary mercantilism people of letters make money out of their writings pretend to financial independence and they write garbage to flatter the opinion of their public  édouard berth les méfaits des intellectuels the misdeeds of the intellectuals introduction édouard berth disciple of proudhon 
i have had the same experience with journalists citing each other about my books without the smallest effort to go to my writingsmy experience is that most journalists professional academics and other in similar phony professions dont read original sources but each other largely because they need to figure out the consensus before making a pronouncement  nassim taleb antifragile

Jon Anthony,2016-11-21T19:03:19.410+02:00,examples that show the globalists are losing ground,"home  badge abuse  community outraged after video shows a cop throwing down a yo girl community outraged after video shows a cop throwing down a yo girl matt agorist september    comments 
asheville nc  a video posted to facebook this week has the internet in an uproar as it shows an asheville police officer allegedly assaulting a yearold girl 
the video shows a short interaction between yearold kacee fleming and officer shalin oza according to cherrell mooney the woman who took the video fleming approached police as they were arresting her brother dominic fore according to apd they had a warrant for fores arrest 
she was asking them why are yall arresting my brother mooney said the officer was being rude they didnt want to talk to them 
the video apparently shows the aftermath of this questioning as the officer grabs fleming and throws her to the ground 
according to police fleming yelled at officers and allegedly reached into her brothers pockets to retrieve his personal items as he was being arrested flemings actions then caused officers to have to deal with her the video is the result of fleming apparently being dealt with 
according to police fleming was arrested and charged as an adult for resisting obstructing or delaying an officer sgt noland brown who was on the scene also told news  that she is charged with misdemeanor assault on a government official 
i have no trust in the police anymore said crystal fleming  kasees mother according to news  she says her daughter was trying to communicate with police before the incident to tell them that fore had just gotten out of the icu 
she is not trying to be disrespectful said crystal fleming but yall are not listening they were not listening 
you wonder why people are running around here saying black lives matter she continues thats why because they really dont think our lives matter because he could have pulled her to the side talked to her he didnt even do none of that 
according to police they were there for another incident but when they saw fore they decided to arrest him too 
the asheville police department released the following statement 
the asheville police department has viewed the video circulating on social media regarding the arrest of a yearold female on the evening of september   
the nine second video is only a small portion of a much longer incident 
the asheville police department is in the process of conducting a full administrative investigation that will review all evidence including the video circulating on social media and body worn camera footage in our review 
the asheville police department is dedicated to providing the best possible police service and upon completion of the review will take appropriate action if deemed necessary 
anyone with additional video footage or information regarding this incident is encouraged to contact our professional standards office at   
according to news  when they requested the body cam video from the scene that night they were denied matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share google  keysbum 
ooooh the adrenaline rush that brave heroic cop must have enjoyed after overpowering that dangerous villainous little girl he can proudly puff his chest out after that one nishi 
the disturbing thing is that they actually do that they feel good about doing this kind of thing they are convinced that what they are doing is morally just and necessary reminds me of hobbesto this war of every man against every man this also is consequent that nothing can be unjust the notions of right and wrong justice and injustice have there no place where there is no common power there is no law where no law no injustice force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues jonathan sabo 
this is not about black  it is about getting involved in a legal arrest  razedbywolvs 
no its about black because if it wasnt white people might get pissed enough to do something about it that would not work out to well for the officers involved in legal arrests james michael 
she had every right to require he state why he was being arrested and the officer had no lawful arrest she also had every right to free the man from being kidnapped by a traitor you retard 
now why was he being arrested bruismenot 
what a lovely mouth that mother has no wonder the kid has no respect for the law also it looks like the kid was resisting including standingsteppingstomping on the cops left foot oh well gininitaly 
i looked at that video  times and never saw her stomp on his precious foot she was  and hardly lbs soaking wet youre telling me that a big adult male couldnt contain her threat without shoving her to the ground bruismenot 
unfortunately cops arent psychic and they have to react quickly to protect themselves the girl was obviously highly emotional when she approached the situation one of the most dangerous times to interfere with police activity is during the arrest of a family member 
its easy to sit back and criticize the cop but he doesnt know her intent nor if in the dim light shes carrying a weapon of some sort you cant just go stomping up on an arrest situation ignoring orders to stay back 
have you ever fought an emotionally charged  year old girl they fight like wild cats just watch a video on you tube some time if you havent age doesnt always matter and  year olds are adult sized 
cops dont put on the uniform to get hurt teach your children to respect the law show respect yourself and you wont have to worry about adult sized teenagers being thrown down by big mean cops 
also maybe your device is better than mine but it looks to me like the girls foot lands on his left foot i could be wrong in that ill look at it again gininitaly 
hogwash spoken like a cop of today who needs an excuse to brutalize for profit or the pleasure of being a bully against the defenseless 
lumberjacks farmers emts firemen and fishermen have more dangerous jobs than cops and i happen to be old enough to see my towns  years of service police chief retire without ever having fired a shot at a human being and that was  yrs of drunks with guns broken bottles or knives belligerent mouthy kids family disputes and all the rest so whats the difference between then and now his talent and yours attitude and the desire to deescalate situations not intensify them to the point of murder 
since  and the patriot act they seem to have been given permission to make us citizens their victims instead of their friends family and neighbors that they were once supposed to protect and serve 
you will get no get out of jail free or pity cards from me cops today or rather whats left after the good cops get fed up and quit or were drummed off the force because those that remain are drunk on their own power over people and revel in the violence that they create 
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxfaif_a_e bruismenot 
i didnt say the cop did a great job i didnt say that i would have reacted the same way i didnt say that i thought the video looked fine i was simply trying to give an explanation for what we saw on the video gininitaly 
and just who gave you that job or why you thought that cop needed defending you invented an aggression by that  yr old complained about language defended the cop no matter what the video actually showed and projected your prejudices onto the entire situation in my book that makes you a worthless witness who deals in fantasy not fact no different than a lot of chicken chit americans who think defending the police or government will get you a free ticket off of the auschwitz express you should never defend the indefensible 
all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men to do nothing bruismenot 
i take it we cant be friends then stir up the sjws all day long if you must who does anyone call if they get jacked shot stabbed or whatever next time you are the victim of a real crime go ahead and call those same sjws to save your bacon see how many show up and how far you get 
lady dont assume you know me you dont know my story if you didwe might could be friends gininitaly 
i have no idea what a sjw is is that police jargon i know one thing i wouldnt be calling an american cop theyd end up shooting my dog my kid or me if they even managed to make it to the right address in some steroid induced adrenaline rush i dont need those kinds of jacked up people in my life youtheyve lost all credibility as anything that could or would help id ask a bystander for assistance before calling a cop any day 
your words are quite indicative of where your loyalties lie and if you think im assuming then you should come clean and tell your story and at that point i might reevaluate my take on who you are and why you seem to need to defend the indefensible in what used to be the formerly free usa 
httpkilledbypolicenet free_willey 
your explanation is bogus and it clearly indicates that you are the problem the cop should have been arrested on the spot for assault this is what makes all cops criminals they fail to arrest and charge crimes against their buddies in blue you included it astounds me that you guys continue to make your job on a daily basis more and more dangerous putrid ignorance and arrogance and a complete non caring attitude for people in general is what is on display at todays pds this is not the service that we hired you for cops work an entire lifetime to avoid disdain for the people they have sworn to serve only to have pds hire the lowest of iq and then train them to see the public as the enemy once you start to justify the violent actions of todays cops you need to leave the force furthermore you do not have to be a psychic as you claim to see that the cop simply became upset lost control and used violence to assault this less than  lb person bruismenot 
sure arrest all the cops then whose going to keep all the people safe who dont have or know how to defend themselves from the predators in the world 
what would you do james michael 
kops have no duty to keep anyone safe moronlook up the hundreds of citesstating exactly that james michael 
if you have respect for xops these days you either have your head up your ass or are stupid badcopwatch 
this cop should be taught a lesson bruismenot 
why for doing his job and just what lesson would you have him taught do you know him his training or his history if so please enlighten us elropo 
his job my ass i am in complete agreement with gininitaly in my town we have the same situations with no brutality from the police they are pretty much respected here some rare exceptions it all depends on the mayor chief council hiring policies and just whether they keep assholes on the job gininitaly 
thx and glad to see that you are blessed with a rational community good to know there are a few left out there  bruismenot 
ok so you can tell this cop is an ass hole from this short clip you can tell that this upset girl is an angel bravo for you then bravo for you 
fine now ive wasted enough time on here time to go to work peace james michael 
she asked why her brother was being kidnapped the cop is required to inform her whyor it is unlawfulwe the people she is onehim sworn servantmoron haauwnk 
you need to be strung up for fellating pigs its against your religion james michael 
the nzis were doing their jobs committing treason and murder also moron ibcamn 
cops are such cowards and pussysstep on my feet and im gonna arrest yallcowardscops only feel like real men when they are beating up womenall cops are just plain criminals gina 
you all make me sick the problem today is that we raise children to disrespect authority and then feel we can call moral high ground against those that are in place to help 
our youth need to be taught that they are not able to do whatever they want they need to understand that laws apply to them and if not followed prepare for consequences 
the point of no return that i see in this video is a  year old female that feels she has the right to interfere in an arrest in progress 
and before anyone touts unlawful bull it is clearly stated that a warrant was in place for the arrest and as such she was wrong for interfering 
mom is equally to blame filming it hoping to make a quick buck or news scandal instead of correcting her daughter for her behaviour ibcamn 
so is what your saying is bow down to these retarded criminals and follow orders without question and raise our children to be just like you and never question authority and be a slavesucks to be you stopkingobama 
heres an idea dont interfere with the cops when they are trying to arrest someone you fucking creampuff libtard crybabies just dont get it fucking morons think they can adjudicate a case in the streets while the arrest is taking place try protesting real abuse instead of cases like these where morons get what they deserve for being stupid james michael 
you have the right and the duty to stop any sworn servant unlawfully arresting someonethat is an act called aggravated kidnapping and is an act of treason stopkingobama 
you have the right to resist an unlawful arrest they had a warrant for her idiot brothers arrest even resisting an unlawful arrest is a good way to get killed let them cuff you and if they were acting as egregiously as you think they were tell it to the judge if you have video to support your probably unfounded claim all the better 
all you fucking limpwristed cream puff milquetoast libtard cophating social justice warriors with no respect for law and order should just be rounded up and shot or at least sent to iran it would make this country a hell of a lot better off james michael

among the many wikileaks emails that were dumped this summer it was clear that hillary clinton is not as popular as the media would have you believe in fact it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her 
the gateway pundit reported  
shes the astroturfed candidate hillary is sooo unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies 
 biggest scoops from the dncleaks wikileak 
wikileaks released nearly  hacked emails it says are from the accounts of democratic national committee officials on friday 
the emails are devastating for hillary clinton according to at least one hacked email hillary clinton has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online she also pays millennials to show up at her rallies 
hillarys support is all a lie its all astroturfed everything this woman does is all a lie  even her rallies are fabricated 
if attkissons explanation were not enough how about this tweet regarding the mainstream media putting their collective useful idiot heads together to pitch the same propaganda about donald trump  biggest scoops from the dncleaks httpstcovmtiepspkj 
 mike cernovich  cernovich july   
this should have come as no surprise 
if you remember when her campaign kicked off in  i reported on the fact that more than  of her twitter followers were either completely fake or inactive  
additionally when she had her iowa kickoff event a whopping  people showed up  the majority of those were reporters 
hillary clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid antiamerican liberals and even then it looks like shes having to pay them to actually do anything to support her in other words her candidacy is completely contrived

A. Griffee,2016-11-02T07:00:00.000+02:00,dml provides stunning analysis predicts trump will win presidential election,"by dean daniels  november    politics  
in the summer of  before the current presidential race ignited and two weeks before trump announced his candidacy dml gave a compelling speech during his tour in the state of massachusetts in front of an audience at a small town synagogue the awardwinning businessman and conservative commentator laid out the key component that he believed would catapult any presidential candidate above all the others putting americans first 
dml emphasizes during his americans first speech that the number one issue in america is immigration he explains in crystal clear detail how immigration both legal and illegal goes beyond party identification he says its not a democrat or republican issue  its an american issue 
having traveled the country by car exploring the idea of running for president himself dml got a real sense for what concerned americans most therefore he knew before the rest of us that the ideal candidate of  would be someone who has the audacity and the courage to tell the american people he or she will commit to the deportation of illegal immigrants 
remember its not an antiimmigration its an antiillegal immigration and its about being proamerica 
while putting americans first would have been dmls campaign theme had he chosen to run for the highest office in the land this strategy was instead adopted by none other than donald jtrump this is one major reason why dml has supported trump since day one 
trump has done more than proven dml correct trump has proven how powerful the  americans first ideology is during a day and age when progressive politicians like barack obama and hillary clinton are catering to foreign workers and corporate donors at the expense of the american people who are left to rot on the back burner 
watch an excerpt from the speech and then check out dmls electoral map and how he sees trump winning on tuesday

comets which helped lead to his equations of gravity so if eyewitness accounts are so unreliable how did newton use them to come up with his theories we also saw this with meteorites this is from wiki

former defense minister of canada paul hellyer has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the state canada on the ceta treaty ceta stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet paul hellyer called the treaty therefore comprehensive trade and takeover agreement with this convention which comes out of the hat of the international bankers  families will obtain control over almost the entire world constitutions of member countries will no longer apply only the will of the  families the elite will apply 
the lawsuit was officially filed on october  of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of parliament through an act of parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign ceta and  or perform without having this treaty first by the parliament through official channels  the solid majority of the ceta articles and their impact encroach on exclusive provincial spheres or forumprotected by the division of powers under the constitution act  
most of the ceta provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the canadian constitutional law  the ceta gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected judiciary in canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in canada without any judicial oversight or jurisdiction of the canadian courts over the disputes and 
ceta removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the canadian legal system and various articles of the ceta violate constitutional enshrined rights in the charter of rights and freedoms  and overrides charter guarantees that ground canadas ability to mount public programs on health education social services and public utilitiesincluding the elimination of subsidies monopolies and state enterprises for public welfare in short the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about those of the canadian constitution and canadian citizens 
various provisions of ceta violated constitutional builtrights enshrined in the document charter of rights and freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health education social services and public funds including the termination of subsidies  monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest in short the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the canadian constitution and its inhabitants 
but this is not all paul hellyer which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to canadians and the rest of the world his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world the international bankers international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only  families 
paul hellyer remembers the canada which was separate from the bankers yet not so long ago until  the canadian government expressed its money itself there was no such thing as inflation poverty and debt canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that europe was liberated from the germans at that time life was good cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do from one day to the issued money creation in  the central banks and money was no longer free within a few years canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes paul hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend this affects every canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education health housing etc can be paid without causing debts paul hellyer does the same as foundation for our money aims but in a turbo version he lets no grass grow does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years paul hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat 
now the video of paul hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this 
dear readers this could be the big break this information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers the same applies we can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people the power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it we want a better and fairer world then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for 
privatized money is the reason for all wars privatized money is the cause of poverty oppression exploitation neglect of our elderly and less fortunate privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet now is the chance to get out from under the yoke to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over  years with one goal to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer

politicians are telling trump to knock off such talk but as usual trumps shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum  in which the opposition party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of democratic pressure  is winning the daynone other than billionaire investor and longtime democratic supporter george soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election in favor of clinton  no matter how much of the popular vote and from which battleground states trump capturesas reported by top right news and other outlets during a recent interview with bloomberg news  soros  a democrat megadonor  openly admitted that trump will win the popular vote in a landslidehowever he said that none of that would matter because a president hillary clinton is already a done dealin the interview which is now going viral soros says with certainty that trump will take the popular vote despite what the polls say now which are completely rigged to oversample democrats  but not the electoral college which will go to clintonwhen the reporter asks if that is already a done deal  that clinton will be our next president no matter what  soros says yes and nods his headis soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence or does he truly know something most of us dont knowin a recent column  natural news founder and editor mike adams the health ranger says that soros and democrats have bribed electoral college representatives in a bid to fix the election outcome in favor of clinton in truth that would be the only way it could be done short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting as some reports have already claimed adams further pointed out that soros was one of the main money men behind the black lives matter movement which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country  some of which has led to the deaths of several officers alreadysoros also funds leftwing websites and groups that locate pay and deploy volunteer agitators at trump rallies to start fights and engage in physical violence against trump supporters acts that the establishment media then blames on trump but arent electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that electors district no theyre not ninenine percent of electors have done what theyre supposed to do throughout our history but this is no ordinary election per archivesgov  there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote rather these pledges fall into two categories state law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political partiesin the past the us supreme court has ruled that the constitution doesnt require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and therefore respective political parties may extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties nominees archivesgov notes some state laws hold that faithless electors could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot and could then be replaced by a substitute electorthe supreme court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the constitution no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged said archivesgovthe site notes that throughout our history  percent of electors have voted as required but this is no ordinary time and its no ordinary election  and democrats and the establishment media have already proven that they will do anything to stop a trump presidency plus establishment republicans dont want trump either so you can bet they wouldnt balk at or challenge the

cnn reported the progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners in this case the fake news originated on a dubious site called your news wire which publishes a mix of true slanted and madeup news then like a game of telephone by the time the story got to hannity even the fake facts were wrong 
some rightwing websites spread the story which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop the fake news eventually reached the gateway pundit and to sean hannitys radio show 
after spreading the fake news to millions of listeners hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way i was dealing with more important issues like hrc crimes and lies and how cnn has been colluding with the clinton campaign and cheating bernie sanders 
hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes and how the election is being stolen from donald trump 
how hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the rightwing media echo chamber works nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the republican party belief has replaced fact conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs so that is what they provide 
it doesnt matter if the confirmation is true what matters is that the audience wants it to be true 
sean hannity is pushing fake news and he doesnt care 
this is why there is such a disconnect between republicans and the rest of the country republican voters are living in a fantasy land that donald trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the republican nomination 
the conservative media bubble is alive and well and because of this things will get a lot worse for republicans before they begin to get better",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TrumpHawkins.png,bias,1.0,pollster sees early impact comey clinton fbi email letter swing states,hrafnkell haraldsson wed nov nd know sick tired negative dark divisive dangerous vision behavior people support donald trump share twitter print post speaking reverend samuel delevoe memorial park fort lauderdale tuesday night hillary clinton interrupted donald trump supporter shouted bill clinton rapist doubt working reward offered infowars clinton none rather ignoring man issued stern rebuke stabbing finger man said know sick tired negative dark divisive dangerous vision behavior people support donald trump man continued shout waving sign crowd countered cries hillary hillary said time us say going backwards going forward brighter future protester escorted security clinton told man everyone like may angry something anger plan dont used dont exploited see protesters antics note neither roughed attacked clinton supporters sadly many angry white christians allowing exploited donald trump represents forces deprived american dream man clinton says taken everything given nothing last night florida hillary clinton taking nothing giving everything photo screen capture,1.0

donald trumps deputy campaign manager the clintonobsessed republican operative david bossie told abc news george stephanopoulos this morning that theres an enthusiasm gap and that this bit of math republicans do is trumps path to victory on november  
this is how the conversation went per cbs news sopan deb  as always highlighting the important bits 
stephanopoulos was not about to let bossie get away with the claim about trumps tax returns and hammered him on the issue hes going to release his tax return when he is not under audit david bossie trump deputy campaign manager httpstcoyxvgrjix 
 good morning america gma november   
bossie deflected like a pro you can see why trump hired him 
as a corollary to bossies claims trump suddenly found himself interested in polls again this morning tweeting  wow now leading in abc  washingtonpost poll  to  gone up  points in two weeks mostly before the crooked hillary blowup 
 donald j trump realdonaldtrump november   
the trump campaign has always been about making much out of nothing elections are not rigged if trump gets his way and neither are polls if trump is leading otherwise its all leftwing shenanigans 
however even newt gingrich isnt buying the new poll washington postabc poll is an absurdity trump has not moved up  points in the last  dayshe was never  points behind ignore polls 
 newt gingrich newtgingrich november   
and what trump fails to mention is that his lead disappears if johnson and stein are taken out of the mix then clinton leads by   
these latest claims are an absolute sham as clinton leads overwhelmingly in early voting and comeys email gambit seems to have failed to sway voters to trumps camp 
meanwhile trumps own legal problems are beginning to overwhelm the narrative  and if there is any evidence of a clinton enthusiasm gap it exists only in bossies own head 
david bossie is living proof that clintons vast rightwing conspiracy is real and all the hating on hillary isnt going to change the fact that it is trump who is the crooked candidate not hillary clinton",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hillary_Clinton_23705602384.jpg,bias,1.0,comey letter backfires email scandal revival energizes hillary clinton supporters,jason easley tue nov st pm republicans far removed reality sean hannity spread fake news story radio show nobody noticed difference share twitter print post republicans far removed reality sean hannity spread fake news story radio show nobody noticed difference cnn reported progression events illustrates fake news stories expand spread fringe web sites nationally syndicated radio shows millions listeners case fake news originated dubious site called news wire publishes mix true slanted madeup news like game telephone time story got hannity even fake facts wrong rightwing websites spread story turned tall tale added new details stop fake news eventually reached gateway pundit sean hannitys radio show spreading fake news millions listeners hannity downplayed responsibility get facts right bottom line brought insignificant way dealing important issues like hrc crimes lies cnn colluding clinton campaign cheating bernie sanders hannity busy dealing real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes election stolen donald trump hannity put fake story air perfect example rightwing media echo chamber works nobody level bothered check facts republican party belief replaced fact conservative media knows audience wants confirmation beliefs provide doesnt matter confirmation true matters audience wants true sean hannity pushing fake news doesnt care disconnect republicans rest country republican voters living fantasy land donald trump able exploit ride whole way republican nomination conservative media bubble alive well things get lot worse republicans begin get better,1.0

whether or not youre a basketball fan youre going to love this story about a bold new humanitarian initiative from the nba in order to help alleviate the refugee crisis in europe the league is housing syrian refugees on whichever half of the court isnt being played on during the game 
now thats making a difference way to go nba 
since the syrian civil war began in  millions of syrians have been displaced but thanks to the generosity of the nba some of them will now find a new home right around the threepoint line on the half of the court that isnt being played on at that time while players occupy one half of the court syrian refugees will have a safe and welcoming space on the other half to reassemble their lives until the ball changes possession and they are shuttled to the opposite end 
wow what a beautiful gesture from the nba with  courts across the country and  games in the  season the league is set to provide housing that periodically oscillates from one half of the court to the other for several thousand syrian refugees this is huge 
in contrast to europes notoriously overcrowded refugee camps the nbas half courts are big enough to comfortably house at least five families around the perimeter and one or two in the paint the refugees also have access to any snack vendors who happen to be milling about the crowd near whichever half of the court theyre on at the time 
of course its a new program and its not perfect there have been several incidents in which refugees have collided with players after failing to get to the other half of the court in time and last night an yearold syrian girl had to be treated for minor injuries after lebron james dunked on her during a fast break 
still according to nba commissioner adam silver the program is a huge step up from the refugee camps abroad 
the syrian refugee crisis is only getting worse meanwhile weve got this half of the court that isnt being played on just collecting dust waiting to be put to good use said silver adding that he felt the league had a moral responsibility to harbor the refugees if we can help these people by sheltering them on one side of the court until theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half as soon as theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half until theres a change in possession then we have an obligation to do that 
its refreshing to see a major organization like the nba reaching out to a group of people who so desperately need our help right now faith in humanity restored",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3429/8/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,0.0,said find miley cyrus alicia vikander zadie smith say,email whether youre basketball fan youre going love story bold new humanitarian initiative nba order help alleviate refugee crisis europe league housing syrian refugees whichever half court isnt played game thats making difference way go nba since syrian civil war began millions syrians displaced thanks generosity nba find new home right around threepoint line half court isnt played time players occupy one half court syrian refugees safe welcoming space half reassemble lives ball changes possession shuttled opposite end wow beautiful gesture nba courts across country games season league set provide housing periodically oscillates one half court several thousand syrian refugees huge contrast europes notoriously overcrowded refugee camps nbas half courts big enough comfortably house least five families around perimeter one two paint refugees also access snack vendors happen milling crowd near whichever half court theyre time course new program perfect several incidents refugees collided players failing get half court time last night yearold syrian girl treated minor injuries lebron james dunked fast break still according nba commissioner adam silver program huge step refugee camps abroad syrian refugee crisis getting worse meanwhile weve got half court isnt played collecting dust waiting put good use said silver adding felt league moral responsibility harbor refugees help people sheltering one side court theres change possession sheltering half soon theres change possession sheltering half theres change possession obligation refreshing see major organization like nba reaching group people desperately need help right faith humanity restored,1.0

KD7ONE,2016-10-26T16:50:00.000+03:00,no title,"whether you are looking to attract a longterm girlfriend or wife or you are experimenting with shorterterm liaisons learning the art of seduction is essential reams of content have been written on the topic both on rok and elsewhere indeed its possible to get lost in a tsunami of pickup advice
but while it can be useful to absorb successful peoples techniques a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself to that end here is a list of the top five habits ive observed in men who are great with women
 they take every opportunity 
guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them in this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs they know that the market is in a constant state of flux and that change is at the heart of opportunity as such like the speculators of pussy they are they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid regardless of the circumstances
game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time i would wholeheartedly endorse this i would also add that however many opportunities youre taking now there are always more to be had i for example will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while im traveling to my office on the subway there are so many cute girls on their way to work in london or any reasonablysized commuter city and yet guys wont talk to them rationalizing that it is too early shell think im crazy or whatever in actual fact ive probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time
so next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances it is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game
 they notice and follow up on iois 
while most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you socalled indicators of interest or iois without you having done anything
while i would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay i would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them and to follow up with alacrity not only do direct iois frequently lead to sex but also if you fail to pursue a potentiallyinterested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards men after all are the more romantic gender there are few more lasting selfinflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated had you had the courage to speak to her
the successful seducer is always on the lookout for iois therefore and hell execute quickly when he gets them even if it means deviating slightly from his routine for example a while back i was on a subway train when i got strong direct eye contact from an attractive petite and very feminine brunettejust my type once youve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid ioi from casual interest but the best way to describe it is as that rabbit in the headlights look that girls give when they are truly smitten
well she was giving me that look and i knew i had to follow up when she got of the train i went right after her introduced myself on the platform took her number and then left a drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later had i not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected
remember always be willing to go after a sure thing and never leave money on the table
 they stand out from the crowd 
every truly successful seducer i have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd this can manifest itself in many ways but primarily im talking about standing out physically in terms of what you wear and standing out in terms of your personality
while the old concept of peacocking is rightly maligned by both men and women these days there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that all else being equal the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacksandsweatshirt counterpart a former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else ive ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession
i appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity what real man takes so much care over his clothes but remember that narcissism is one of the three dark triad characteristics that are like catnip to women along with machiavellianism and psychopathy therefore taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lotif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in
your personality too should be larger than life dont be obnoxious but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group
 they are dominant 
there can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant now of course the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no nevertheless within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance  both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity
the key thing here is to appear decisive and unwaveringeven if secretly you arent for example after youve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date try getting up taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi when she questions what youre doing just say were going back to my place to watch a movie doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her
now in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and thats fine  just do the actions anyway and see what happens shes much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesnt she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet
 they dont apologize 
highly successful seducers never apologizeor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway the fact of the matter is you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs if you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cockyfunny humor then the chances are youre going to offend someone every so often
now im not recommending that you should be a dickbe classy and convivial in all your interactions but the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal valhalla if someone gets offended then make a joke but dont apologize as long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for
remember an apology is a submission to someone elses frameand that is never a good look

Mike Rivero,2016-11-23T00:49:00.000+02:00,flashback  hillary clintons kkk smear against trump was democrat strategy,"november   by wire leave a comment 
the person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the white house it may well be donald j trump but further due diligence is required to ensure that american democracy is not threatened 
st century wire says 
although the election was called on nov th the democratic partys ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming president is still ongoing 
for those of us with long enough memories the democratic party their media operatives and the clinton campaign were claiming that trump and the gop would be engaged in this very same behavior after hillary clinton won the presidency as expected 
notice how the shoe is now on the other foot 
its interesting reading past stories by news sources linked to the clinton campaign and john podesta as politico has who ran a feature on aug th entitled why the gop will never accept president hillary clinton which lays out the case of hillarys lock on the white house and how the evil republicans will not accept her eventual election victory 
will donald trump respect the peaceful transition of power howled cnns wolf blitzer in the runup to the election the question now is will the democrats respect the result and simply move on as they say 
of course we now know that journalists like wolf at cnn were getting their talking points directly the clinton campaign  
as it turns out the only thing illegitimate about the  election was the mainstream corporate media 
more form the guardian 
the guardian 
a growing number of academics and activists are calling for us authorities to fully audit or recount the  presidential election vote in key battleground states in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers 
the loose coalition which is urging hillary clintons campaign to join its fight is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week according to two people involved 
the document which is currently  pages long focuses on concerns about the results in the states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin 
im interested in verifying the vote said dr barbara simons an adviser to the us election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting we need to have postelection ballot audits simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement 
a second group of analysts led by the national voting rights institute founder john bonifaz and professor alex halderman the director of the university of michigans center for computer security and society is also taking part in the push for a review and has been in contact with simons 
in a blogpost early on wednesday halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching 
unfortunately nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now in the next several days to petition for recounts he said 
the developments follow clintons surprise defeat to donald trump in the  november vote and come after us intelligence authorities released public assessments that russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from democratic officials before the election

sen marco rubio rfla took the stage in orlando at calle orange a puerto ricanthemed festival on sunday when some in the crowd started booing npr reported  
the jeering got louder as the cubanamerican senator seeking reelection after dropping his presidential bid earlier this year was introduced 
and when the emcee asked for applause as rubio took the same boos drowned out any supporters in the crowd npr added 
thank you for having me today rubio said in spanish i want you to enjoy this day were not going to talk about politics today thank god for this beautiful day and for our freedom our democracy our vote and our country god bless you all thank you very much 
he left the stage to more boos from the crowd according to the report 
snip 
rubio is running against rep patrick murphy d and the latest average of polls in the race shows rubio ahead by about  points 
murphys campaign seized on the sunday incident and blasted out video it says shows the booing it also noted that murphy attended the festival with a leader for puerto rican communities rep nydia velazquez while marco rubio was booed off the stage 
rubios campaign shared a video with the hill monday that it says counters what the murphy campaign sent out and shows him being greeted enthusiastically as he moves through the crowd 
snip
