if you are a western man under  your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography epic divorce rates hypersexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity at virtually any age you could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier it wasnt something remarkable and youve both probably forgotten about it years later you could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case
while american culture evolved or as many fairly and convincingly argue de volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws
federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent instead leaving it to the states to codify though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under  and you may think thats the law of the land federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution by the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her right good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography 
what is the age of consent in america i wouldnt even trust her fake id
the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from  to   sometimes lower in the case of married couples its even lower in some foreign countries by the way say youre an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country but still under you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty
why is this significant for starters the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of  to be a child that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic however
dont take one for the team
for example back when you were  and your girlfriend was  and the age of consent in your state was  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since
till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier thinking nothing of it you tell him the basic details admitting to sexual contact and bam you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor any defense of her consenting multiple times or even that you did not know she was underage is irrelevantas a minor she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges
the long arm of the law may reach you 
well thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway right not so fast first if you have amassed any assets years later she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask bill clinton 
moreover just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you do not assume you are in the clear statutes of limitations can be changed  once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game
while the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl perhaps even if you yourself were underage if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction
this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute continue to keep quiet regardless prosecutors come and go and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges
branded for life 
if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry  perhaps for life say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you well guess what you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction
imagine driving down the road years later a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice a sex offense arrest pops up think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny what are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day for better or worse cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible
you will get no breaks so watch yourself and stfu yes of course you both knew what you were doing back on prom night and yes we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences  but you sir are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white nonislamic and attending college or boarding school particularly a prestigious institution  forewarned is forearmed
young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation and if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader dont tell that story to anyone ever the political climate is not favorable to youand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-03T18:46:55.411+02:00,fbi wiretapped corruption suspect discussing clinton deals,"whos really to blame for the corrupting influence of money in washington dc november   walter williams 
microsoft cofounder bill gates having a net worth of  billion and amazoncom ceo jeff bezos having a net worth of  billion are the nations two richest men they are at the top of the forbes  list of americas superrich individuals people who have net worths of billions of dollars many see the rich as a danger new york times columnist bob herbert wrote it doesnt really matter what ordinary people want the wealthy call the tune and the politicians dance his colleague paul krugman wrote on paper were a onepersononevote nation in reality were more than a bit of an oligarchy in which a handful of wealthy people dominate its sentiments like these that have led me to wish there were a humane way to get rid of the rich for without having the rich around to be whipping boys and distract our attention we might be able to concentrate on whats best for the  percent of the rest of us 
lets look at the power of the rich with all the money that gates bezos and other superrich people have what can they force you or me to do can they condemn our houses to create space so that another individual can build an auto dealership or a casino parking lot can they force us to pay money into the governmentrun  and doomed  obamacare program can they force us to bus our children to schools out of our neighborhood in the name of diversity can they force us to buy our sugar from a highcost domestic producer rather than from a lowcost caribbean producer the answer to all of these questions is a big fat no 
you say williams i dont understand let me be more explicit bill gates cannot order you to enroll your child in another school in order to promote racial diversity he has no power to condemn your house to make way for a casino parking lot unless our elected public officials grant them the power to rip us off rich people have little power to force us to do anything a lowly municipal clerk earning  a year has far more lifeanddeath power over us it is that type of person to whom we must turn for permission to build a house ply a trade open a restaurant and do myriad other activities its government people not rich people who have the power to coerce us and rip us off they have the power to make our lives miserable if we disobey this coercive power goes a long way toward explaining legalized political corruption 
take just one of thousands of examples the fanjuls are among the biggest sugar cane growers and they coown the worlds largest refining company american sugar refining which markets its product under the brand names domino ch redpath tate  lyle and florida crystals during the  election cycle florida crystals contributed more than  to candidates and political spending groups it spent more than  million lobbying congress the us departments of agriculture and commerce and the office of the us trade representative heres my question to you do you think it forked over all that money to help our elected representatives uphold and defend the us constitution nonsense the fanjuls and other sugar producers want congress to use tariffs to keep foreignproduced sugar out of our country so they can reap the financial benefits from being able to charge americans two to three times the world price of sugar 
so heres the ultimate question if some rich people can line the pockets of politicians to do their bidding at the expense of the rest of us whos to blame i think its we the people who are to blame for not using our votes to run such politicians out of town  and thats most of them but that might be deceitful of us for we also ask politicians to enable us to live at the expense of others",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hill1.png?itok=2WFcOaHn,hate,Real,hillarys castro endorsement,nigerian novelist wonders everyone loves hillary november daniel greenfield everyone love hillary clinton hard say unfavorable ratings hit makes popular bubonic plague obamacare osama bin ladens corpse much go atlantic decided run piece chimamanda adichie titledwhy hillary clinton widely loved response seeing name chimamanda adichie probably huh unless youre gender studies student ivy case know exactly love chimamanda adichie nigerian novelist whose feminists big circles clinton campaign unbearably awkward panegyric adichie obvious attempt channel canned obama poetry like hillary branding fails badly howlers like millions admire tapestry hillary clintons past people hillary clinton becomes first woman president united states weep joy quite hymn comrade stalin getting means except tow truck theres phrasing oh phrasing hillary clinton guilty immediately stepped view american public first lady arkansas awkward attempt channel obama poetry instead reads like dvd manual badly translated japanese atlantic piece full lines straddle border tineared propagandistic cliche bad writing lawyer full dreams guilty traditional first lady offended old patriarchal order theres theme article deny reality conservative writer labeled congenital liar first lady label stuck repeated overand convenient label harness misogyny liar hostility engendered could possibly first lady refused still silent liar reemerged election even though politifact respected source information politicians certified honest politicians perfect timing defense would right hillary clinton shouted rally new york dont worry hillary honest politicians site supporting said words repeated context begun breathe thrum life especially emails press coverage emails become unclear morass emails must mean something terrible often invoked classified emails illegal server violation regulations dealing handling classified material thats got lots context coverup people love hillary clinton know system state department old stodgy nothing like blackberrys smooth whirl hillary clinton used blackberry wanted keep using became secretary state people love hillary know love high tech blackberry hillary love blackberry lawyer full dreams fights children migrant workers loves smooth whirl politifact thrums life says blackberry honest iphone hillary many dreams thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly offend traditional stodgy patriarchal order system american conservative media saw opportunity blow emails story proportion soon followed almost bashfully rest american media works nigeria thats works america objective basis equate hillary clinton opponent theyre mammals need oxygen live theyre better writers chimamanda adichie people love hillary clinton see failings general american media news entertains rather informs bristle benign stories covered ominous tone bristle hug blackberry weep fear patriarchal stodgy systems prevent hillary thrumming first lady north america know bit careful understand cannot afford spontaneity would think six figure speeches could afford little actions falsely magnified leaned caution wrapped kind caution sometimes makes appear stilted wrapped caution whirling blackberry one hand bristled public retracting quills occasionally hissing informed fashion children migrant workers admired tapestry past millions americans selfindulgent expectation politician perfect frustrated hillary clinton allowed complexity get beyonce phone think adichie got another hit,1.0

hillary the spy  updated info 
let us start with an historical fact treason and betrayal by the highest levels is a common feature of history whether it is judas vs jesus brutus vs julius caesar benedict arnold the rosenbergs jonathan pollard aldrich ames robert hanssen it is just a fact of life it does happen 
back in  when bill clinton was running for reelection he authorized the transfer of highly sensitive technology to china this technology had military applications and allowed china to close the gap in missile performance with the united states the transfers were opposed and severely criticized by the defense department 
at the same time bill clinton was transferring this technology to china huge donations began to pour into his reelection campaign from the us companies allowed to sell the technology to china and from american citizens of chinese descent the fact that they were us citizens allowed them to donate to political campaigns but it later emerged that they were acting as conduits for cash coming in from asian sources including chinese intelligence agencies the scandal eventually became known as chinagate 
john huang 
a close associate of indonesian industrialist james riady huang initially was appointed deputy secretary of commerce in  by  however he moved to the democratic national committee where he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources huang later pleaded guilty to one felony count of campaign finance violations 
charlie trie 
like john huang trie raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources to democratic campaign entities he was a regular white house visitor and arranged meetings of foreign operators with clinton including one who was a chinese arms dealer his  contribution to clintons legal defense fund was returned after it was found to have been largely funded by asian interests trie was convicted of violating campaign finance laws in  
one of tries main sources of cash was chinese billionaire ng lap seng according to a senate report ng lap seng had connections to the chinese government seng was arrested in  over an unrelated bribery case but this gave investigators the opportunity to question seng about the chinagate scandal former united nations general assembly president john ashe was also caught in the bribery case and was about to testify to the links between the clintons and seng when he was found dead that very morning initially reported as having died from a heart attack johns throat had obviously been crushed at that point the official story changed to him accidentally dropping a barbell on his own throat 
ng lap seng with the clintons 
johnny chung 
gave more than  to the democratic national committee prior to the  campaign but it was returned after officials learned it came from illegal foreign sources chung later told a special senate committee investigating  clinton campaign fundraising that  of his contributions came from individuals in chinese intelligence chung pleaded guilty to bank fraud tax evasion and campaign finance violations 
chinagate documented by judicial watch was uncovered by judicial watch founder larry klayman technology companies allegedly made donations of millions of dollars to various democratic party entities including president bill clintons  reelection campaign in return for permission to sell hightech secrets to china bernard schwartz and his loral space  communication ltd later allegedly helped china to identify the cause of a rocket failure thereby advancing chinas missile program and threatening us national security according to records

Jack Kerwick,2016-10-28T07:55:05.430+03:00,social justice vs truth,"propalestinian propaganda lowering standards of truth in america manipulation by doctored narratives in every sphere october   
reprinted from israelnationalnewscom  
commendably organized american jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott delegitimize and sanction israel however focusing primarily on israel and not also on america and europe is shortsighted 
the bds campaign has not devastated israel economically israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed israels good name and has rendered her and jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic academic and mob attacks 
it has also lowered the standards for truth among americans this is a very important point 
an islamicstyle of jew hatred has merged with western politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for palestinians fakestinians which has infiltrated every corner every crevice of our lives and world it has infected americans and europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class race and ethnicity 
this is utterly astounding amazing really something like this does not happen overnight 
the bds campaign is rooted in the arab league plo and soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mids in the mids the un proposed its infamous zionismracism resolution 
in  the day after israel won yet another war of selfdefense israelnot the arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier 
by the late s edward saids treacherous lying work had begun to have its way with western academics and with westernstyle academics in israel european governments and international organizations 
i only realized how successful his campaign was in  when israel was demonized at a un conference on women in copenhagen the soviets the iranians the arab league the plo roamed the hallways chanting death to israel european feminists called upon palestinian refugees but refused to hear jewishisraeli refugees from arab and muslim countries by  the un world conference against racism in durban was an even more outofcontrol hate fest and riot against israel 
as we approach  un resolutions against israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque unescos recent decision to dejudaize jerusalem the western wall and the first and second temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend at the same time proisrael professors and students in america are increasingly being harassed even fired 
such lies have infiltrated my private social world for example at a recent holiday dinner our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink 
a likeminded gathering yes not exactly one man a genial wellheeled welleducated jewishamerican suddenly began hectoring us about the palestinians what if they did not hate the jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize jews and israelis what if they were peaceful wouldnt we have to admit that palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own you cant deny that the palestinian people have always lived there can you oh my where to start the company included two authorscholars who between them have published  books and thousands of articles many of them dealing with the history and nature of islam tribal gender and religious apartheid israel and antisemitism etc among us was a third author who had also served four tours of duty in the idf i held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table this man was punching way above his pay grade and i could not understand why 
the two authorscholars presented facts cited statistics i pulled down book after book from my shelves we got nowhere look he said i have some really good muslim friends theyre americans totally westernized they are palestinians they strongly feel that this is their identity why deny them the identity of their choice and then i understood that the propalestinianantizionist propaganda behind the relentless bds campaign is successful precisely because so many americans of all ages are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly dont care 
fair is fair he said in other words whats good for the jews has to be good for everyone else if not the jews dont deserve whatever it is either 
heres a man whos not an antisemite or an antizionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonjewish palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than  the year that another stateless peoplethe jewschose a national sovereign identity 
he would not listen to reason it was quite astounding how is this possible 
his mindset is part of our ruling american zeitgeist if rachel dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the naacp if a man can say that hes really a woman trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen yes anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do 
i am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to false ideas that psychologically speaking we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult 
facts alone will not work we must consider all known techniques for deprogramming 
this is one of our greatest challenges",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/nm_1.jpg?itok=2YWPFbXh,hate,Real,zineb el rhazoui charlie hebdo survivor discusses world needs destroy islamic fascism,hillary clinton seeks even unfit secretary state october daniel greenfield never read medieval german folk tales hillary clinton counting chickens theyve hatched preparing hand jobs one handed hand shes busy planning fantasy cabinet fantasy administration big pick makes sense reportedly would like make joe biden secretary state biden obvious choice hes arrogant dumb brimming bright ideas like giving iran money splitting iraq little pieces obviously wouldnt competency pick last time someone qualified secretary state president bushs time office democrats decided would give job consolation prize failed presidential candidates foreign policy important could counted make even bigger mess hillary clinton john kerry joe biden perfect plan want fall guy blame everything dont come obvious joe biden want someone shadowed soft bigotry low expectations youve gotta go joe joe biden could accidentally start ww everyone would shrug say thats joe,1.0
Alex Ansary,2016-11-02T18:22:23.260+02:00,russiaus plutonium deal no longer in effect,"fbi releases clinton foundation investigation records  
daily caller 
the fbi on tuesday released documents related to a nowclosed federal investigation of an alleged paytoplay scheme involving bill clinton and the clinton foundation 
the documents which are heavily redacted regard the investigation of clintons lastminute pardon of marc rich a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in the us for tax evasion 
the jan   pardon sparked the last controversy to befall the scandalplagued clinton administration richs exwife denise donated more than  million to various clinton and democratic entities including the democratic national committee hillary clintons new york senate campaign and the clinton foundation 
the release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized but the dump is noteworthy for two reasons it reminds voters that the clinton white house and clinton foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning paytoplay allegations the clinton foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple fbi field offices 
it also comes as the fbi is locked in a bitter standoff with the clinton foundation and the justice department over fbi director james comeys handling of the hillary clinton email investigation 
the newlyreleased files include one entry which shows that the required pardon standards and procedures were not followed prior to the rich pardon 
roger adams the us pardon attorney at the time testified to congress in feb  that none of the regular procedures were followed ahead of the rich reprieve 
former attorney general eric holder is also mentioned in the file it cites holders testimony that he was the only person who worked at doj  he was deputy attorney general at the time  about the rich pardon from the fbis clinton foundation investigation files 
a grand jury was convened to weigh the merits of the case but no indictments were handed down ironically the law enforcement official who closed the case was fbi director comey he served as deputy attorney general in the george w bush administration 
the fbis website suggests that more clinton foundation investigation records could be coming in the future 
this initial release consists of material from the fbis files related to the william j clinton foundation  a nonprofit c organization the site reads the bulk of these records come from a  fbi investigation into the pardon of marc rich  aka marcell david reich by president clinton in  it was closed in  
the fbi did not respond to a request for more information on future releases 
update clinton campaign press secretary brian fallon questioned the release 
the fbi issued a statement late tuesday afternoon saying that the file was released in response to a foia request 
the fbis records management division receives thousands of foia requests annually which are processed on a first in first out fifo basis the statement reads 
by law foia materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the fbis public reading room shortly after they are processed per the standard procedure for foia these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the fbis public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures",english,amtvmedia.com,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/581787bec46188db298b45b4.jpg,bs,Fake,russiaus plutonium deal longer effect,fbi releases clinton foundation investigation records daily caller fbi tuesday released documents related nowclosed federal investigation alleged paytoplay scheme involving bill clinton clinton foundation documents heavily redacted regard investigation clintons lastminute pardon marc rich billionaire fugitive wanted us tax evasion jan pardon sparked last controversy befall scandalplagued clinton administration richs exwife denise donated million various clinton democratic entities including democratic national committee hillary clintons new york senate campaign clinton foundation release provides little way information already publicized dump noteworthy two reasons reminds voters clinton white house clinton foundation embroiled investigation concerning paytoplay allegations clinton foundation reportedly investigated present multiple fbi field offices also comes fbi locked bitter standoff clinton foundation justice department fbi director james comeys handling hillary clinton email investigation newlyreleased files include one entry shows required pardon standards procedures followed prior rich pardon roger adams us pardon attorney time testified congress feb none regular procedures followed ahead rich reprieve former attorney general eric holder also mentioned file cites holders testimony person worked doj deputy attorney general time rich pardon fbis clinton foundation investigation files grand jury convened weigh merits case indictments handed ironically law enforcement official closed case fbi director comey served deputy attorney general george w bush administration fbis website suggests clinton foundation investigation records could coming future initial release consists material fbis files related william j clinton foundation nonprofit c organization site reads bulk records come fbi investigation pardon marc rich aka marcell david reich president clinton closed fbi respond request information future releases update clinton campaign press secretary brian fallon questioned release fbi issued statement late tuesday afternoon saying file released response foia request fbis records management division receives thousands foia requests annually processed first first fifo basis statement reads law foia materials requested three times posted electronically fbis public reading room shortly processed per standard procedure foia materials became available release posted automatically electronically fbis public reading room accordance law established procedures,1.0
admin,2016-10-27T16:41:44.825+03:00,meet peter kadzik  another clinton stooge at the justice department,"last week i expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions  these matter much in prompting us to take action or not to to think about something or not to sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls ignore our own needs or refraining from caring about our own interests whereas others push theirs every day they can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after shortterm pleasure or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and fingerwaving against men of their own kin
pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking rather it is the exact opposite as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotiondetermined actions once we have gained awareness of passions we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why
following this idea i made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy hope and love today i will do the same with four other passions or emotions admiration shame humility and fear
 admiration 
society i think should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta malesas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundarieshence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor of course this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy unmanly men women should also be trained into validating more manlier men and here admiration comes into play
as nassim taleb put it we are living more and more in an extremistan where those at the highest level take the lions share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder girls today tend to admire only the most famous or highstatus people which leads them to despise the ninetynine per cent this exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man as long as he achieves the minimum andor is upstanding and dutiful gets his fair share a more democratic but still conditional distribution of girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition 
girls should also admireand not mockproper feminine role models upstanding mothers females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl
 shame 
shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short if our actions fall short and we fail to notice we can be shamed or made to notice shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed but unlike embarrassment also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others neel burton heaven and hell  chap p
a particularly strong emotion shame usually comes as a blow makes one lose face or composure to eventually feel guilt or remorse just like other strong emotions it has been used with consumed malignancy by the left
leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery the holocaust an oppression of minority groups or racism as these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt the sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up being shamed as a racist or nazi can be enough to endure rejection from ones family lose reputation and employment
shame can be aroused through two levers the standards one agrees with and ones purported responsibility both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberalfavored groups as for the standards feminists attacked what they called slutshaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior and as for the responsibility pretty much all those who claim to identify with a minority tend to deny all by slipping it over the majoritys shoulders
this is how you get persistent offenders or jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse whereas the productive working and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white in the current year better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading europe than a young virgin of european descent
what we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice as people evidently hate being shamed especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others
shame the fatties  shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious recall the selfdetermination of antiwhite liberals and criminals they all made free choices they should carry all associated responsibility
as for us we must keep our face straight never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical sjws if they appeal to moral standards put forth your own as legitimate if they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility emphasize theirsand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors
even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn likewise granting certain people or groups a constant deresponsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything criminals of said groups have agency and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well
shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable the liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens in spite of how much the latter to house the former allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terroristswhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ist or phobic acquaintance
turn the table shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long
 humility 
current year girls overinflated ego is enough notwithstanding economic or racial factors to explain a host of social problems blinded by it girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings shortterm desires or by the latest fashions around they drink loads of booze fuck with random strangers reframe their story as a rape later so they can blame it all on the guy  they never learn to cook clean take care of something else than their instagram account and corporate career speaking of corporate isnt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment sex and have almost nothing whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can havetakeit all
ego makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance it leads to complacency merciless exploitation of others refusal to take responsibility and open despise
augustine of hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues this makes sense if ones ego is inflated one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomingsthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury parce que je le vaux bien  as says a famous brand of cosmetics instead of focusing on selfimprovement or caretaking
though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed as the survival of basic family units depends on it bloated ego is a general disease in our age men too can be sold the idea that say being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves its not all about our individual selves
 fear 
readers asked for it so here it is fear is a very powerful emotion to the point of prompting one to freeze flee abandon a previously planned course of action or never even think to consider an idea or an action the left has been using it in two different albeit complementary ways
first it has constantly accused conservatives to play on fears implying irrational or unjustified fears when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment when the  immigration act was voted democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of america and that any suspicion it might happen was highly emotional in france the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations here the left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable fear
well what happened since doesnt it look like every fear from the right was justifiedespecially since the postww right has always been incredibly wary not to say coward when it came to criticize the lefts moral high ground
second the left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do namely stirring fear about political bogeymen liberals invented rape culture or patriarchal oppression when men actually became weaker they associated to nazism any white person who assumes his race should basically survive they shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call white supremacists as if defending ones right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being hitler himself
whites were led to fear their own supposed authoritarian tendencies as the shrewd jews who intrigued through the frankfurt school put it see kevin macdonald culture of critique  chap whites were led to fear some of their fearsbetter have ones daughter killed by muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites because racism is so evil boo
when i was younger i noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people they were much more fearless they had this devilmaycare provocative attitude which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females not incidentally the first movie of the french essayist alain soral confessions dun dragueur confessions of a womanizer shows a young arab with decent pickup experience taking a young middleclass white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity
feeling fear is a necessary step in life fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being fearful or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fearmongering
on the flip side being feared by others is not always a negative some people need to be afraid to respect you if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity they will harm and exploit you such people just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect should be kept in check by a minimal fear better be feared and respected than getting tread upon
conclusion frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to as you have to the left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing when we fail whatever the reason we are despised as weak or losers and when we succeed they say we are privileged and oppressive in both cases the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us no matter what we actually do 
fortunately it is always possible to turn the tables provided we keep a tight frame and change these emotions as well for example when we are weak we should elicit empathy be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities and when we are strong we should elicit admiration and trust
think frame feel positive about us and about what we do get rid of those who wont

David Risselada,2016-10-31T13:12:47.326+02:00,the deceptive nature of hillary clinton is right in line with communism,"posted on october   by claire bernish 
censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted 
facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown 
and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case 
recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang 
that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image 
ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest 
but taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  
trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters 
in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake 
according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives 
in addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals 
all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others 
company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand 
for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors 
indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification 
although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error 
in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences 
earlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots 
however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative 
in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part

after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives 
senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  
in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards 
while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and

red voltaire  ciudad de méxico méxico   de octubre de  français ??????? italiano el  y  de octubre se llevó a cabo en el estado de goa india la octava cumbre de los brics acrónimo de brasil rusia india china y sudáfrica hay que reconocer que el encuentro se desarrolló en medio de una situación profundamente crítica para la economía mundial sin embargo los brics pusieron de manifiesto una vez más su extraordinaria capacidad para transformar un mal momento en una oportunidad para profundizar los vínculos entre ellos desde una perspectiva estratégica
después de que las economías de los brics gozaran de una época dorada en los últimos años sus tasas de crecimiento han sufrido una drástica desaceleración frente a esta difícil coyuntura hoy más que nunca los brics necesitan echar mano de las instituciones financieras que presentaron ante el mundo hace un par de años en fortaleza brasil durante su sexta cumbre   
en abril pasado su nuevo banco de desarrollo realizó sus primeros préstamos    por más de  millones de dólares y para  se calcula que los créditos otorgados podrían alcanzar los   millones de dólares    asimismo esta entidad financiera llevó a cabo en julio de este año una histórica emisión de bonos verdes green bonds en yuanes por un monto equivalente a  millones de dólares    estos títulos financieros a la vez que incrementan la influencia de la moneda china a escala mundial sirven para el financiamiento de grandes proyectos de inversión
por su parte el acuerdo contingente de reservas cra por sus siglas en inglés dotado de   millones de dólares ya está listo para otorgar sus primeras líneas de crédito con el objetivo de estabilizar las balanzas de pagos de los brics según anunció el ministro de finanzas de la india arun jaitley    toda vez que la reserva federal fed de estados unidos amaga permanentemente con subir la tasa de interés de los fondos federales federal funds rate y con ello detonar una nueva turbulencia financiera mundial urge que los brics incrementen cuanto antes los recursos monetarios de su fondo de estabilización pues de lo contrario corren el riesgo de padecer serios estragos por las apuestas especulativas de los grandes bancos de inversiones
de forma simultánea los brics necesitan abrir nuevos frentes de batalla que desafíen de modo abierto la hegemonía de estados unidos y el dólar en el sistema financiero mundial    no solamente a través de los intercambios comerciales en monedas locales sino por ejemplo a través de la acumulación de reservas en yuanes entre sus bancos centrales más todavía luego de que la moneda del pueblo renminbi en chino ingresó oficialmente el pasado º de octubre en los derechos especiales de giro special drawing rights la canasta de divisas de élite creada por el fondo monetario internacional fmi a finales de la década de los    
por añadidura los brics tienen la capacidad de articular una gran alianza financiera con poderosos eslabonamientos geopolíticos entre américa latina asia áfrica y el medio oriente los bancos regionales de desarrollo que están conformados en su mayoría por los países periféricos bien pueden servir a este objetivo el banco asiático de inversiones en infraestructura aiib por sus siglas en inglés el banco del alba alianza bolivariana para los pueblos de nuestra américa e incluso el banco del sur que finalmente arrancará antes de que termine este año
asimismo se ha vuelto una imperiosa exigencia para los brics la puesta en marcha de una agencia de calificación propia que rompa con el predominio aplastante que estados unidos mantiene a través de fitch moodys y standard  poors   
 estas tres agencias de calificación más que realizar evaluaciones que se guíen por criterios de tipo técnico actúan fundamentalmente bajo impulsos de carácter político esto es como auténticas máquinas de guerra degradan las notas de los bonos de deuda soberana y con ello elevan dramáticamente los costos de financiamiento de países como grecia rusia o venezuela
la cohesión económica es otro de los grandes retos si bien es indudable que se ha venido intensificando de forma sustantiva durante los años recientes entre  y  el comercio entre los brics como proporción de sus intercambios totales se duplicó del  al     china es por mucho la economía que está más integrada con los demás brics en contraste los vínculos entre países como la india y sudáfrica son marginales lo mismo sucede entre brasil y rusia por eso es muy pertinente la próxima implementación de un área de libre comercio entre los brics    sin embargo además de echar abajo las barreras arancelarias entre ellos los brics necesitan promover la construcción de cadenas de valor de forma conjunta esto es integrar sus aparatos productivos para incentivar la industrialización de las economías menos aventajadas
en conclusión son muchos los desafíos en el horizonte para estas cinco potencias emergentes estoy convencido de que en lo sucesivo el éxito de los brics dependerá de la capacidad que tengan para reinventarse de su creatividad para articular nuevas dimensiones de cooperación con vistas a cumplir metas de más largo alcance frente a la nueva guerra financiera que prepara estados unidos es momento de que los brics vuelvan a la carga

steve watson prison planetcom october   
gop nominee donald trump who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him shot out a tweet thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines flipping to register votes for hillary clinton when voters choose trump 
a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas trump tweeted 
people are not happy big lines what is going on a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas people are not happy big lines what is going on 
 donald j trump realdonaldtrump october   
as infowars has highlighted  there have already been numerous reports of early voters in texas seeing their ballots flipped from donald trump to hillary clinton a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
while election officials have dismissed the reports suggesting user error is to blame tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time 
larry norden a voting technology expert told npr that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed 
over time as people vote that calibration becomes less and less accurate norden noted 
during elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping indeed the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as the simpsons drew attention to it 
meanwhile the washington post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering trumps rigged election claims 
callum borchers author at the washington post blog the fix writes since the final presidential debate last week many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to donald trump supporters your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election nov  a day later the timess upshot blog increased clintons chances of winning to  percent  an alltime high on monday politicos ben schreckinger wrote that  donald trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed  here at the fix chris cillizza and aaron blake wrote that  donald trumps chances of winning are approaching zero  these are accurate statistically sound statements but they are something else too declarations that trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us  
the latest polls which trump insists are rigged due to oversampling show clinton with a double digit lead 
however hillary clintons campaign manager robby mook has warned that trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right 
weve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before election day mook said urging clinton supporters to vote

tuesday november   by ethan a huff staff writer tags jimmy johns  endangered species  trophy hunting naturalnews the owner of the american fast food chain jimmy johns is under fire after photos emerged of him smiling and giving a thumbs up beside numerous endangered species that hes hunted and killed throughout africa over the years for seemingly no other purpose than simply to invoke death for pleasurereports indicate that jimmy john liautaud has been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars per hunting trip to gain access to these precious species including one particular trophy hunt in which he spent a whopping  just to kill an extremely endangered female black rhino graphic photos of liautaud with this rhino and other animals are available here  but be warned these images are horrifyingly upsettingliautauds trophy hunts are apparently a routine pastime of his just as they are for the many other bored millionaires out there with too much time and money on their hands who seem to get a kick out of taking out the rarest animals on our planet  beautiful creatures like leopards rhinos lions and even elephants which have the largest brains of any land animals its the type of thing that if more people knew about it theyd likely stop eating at jimmy johns altogethermr jimmy johns poaching fetish has been making the media rounds and many are now calling on a national boycott of the sandwich chain which has already been exposed for underpaying its employees and treating them like slave workers the wall street journal wsj reported that social media users had attempted to launch a boycott of jimmy johns using the boycottjimmyjohns hashtag on twitter though the company didnt seem all that phasedstill the issue hasnt gone away and many in the public remain outraged over what they say is reckless and reprehensible behavior not only is liautaud killing these rare and exotic animals in cold blood but hes doing so in such an utterly cruel way that even the most avid hunters would be hardpressed not to cringe or perhaps shed a few tearsusually the animals are lured from a national park on to private property lara starr investigative writer and cofounder of the earth child writes noting that this is not the method liautaud uses to kill his prey trophy hunters will leave out bait play the sounds of other animals to lure them in or a few other tactics to find their animal victimscanned hunting is even worse she adds it is the shooting fish in a barrel version of trophy hunting  the animals are often hand raised so they are tame and dont run away they leave food out for them one day then some coward creeps up and shoots them with a high powered bow or rifle sometimes they dont even have to creep sometimes they just shoot them from the back of a truck then go back to drinking their gin  tonic like it was just a bit of harmless fun trophy hunting costs do not help repopulate endangered animal species one of the excuses often used as justification for expensive trophy hunting escapades is that all that cash ends up getting donated to conservation programs that help repopulate the prairies plains and jungles with endangered species but this isnt actually true as only about two percent of the proceeds from these hunts ends up being used for conservation purposesnontrophy hunting tourism on the other hand is responsible for the bulk of conservation donations  up to  times than what trophy hunting contributes  according to heather callaghan editor of natural blaze  likewise the claim that animals killed on trophy hunts are used to provide food for locals is also bunk as most of the carcasses end up getting left behind for scavengers

Jason Easley,2016-10-29T03:41:08.886+03:00,the real reason why the clinton email scandal is back has nothing to do with helping trump,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  am a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror share on twitter print this post 
a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror 
the report alleges that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin and that russian intelligence claims to have compromised trump on his visits and could blackmail him 
david corn at mother jones reported 
mother jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote the first memo based on the former intelligence officers conversations with russian sources noted russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting trump for at least  years aim endorsed by putin has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance it maintained that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin including on his democratic and other political rivals it claimed that russian intelligence had compromised trump during his visits to moscow and could blackmail him it also reported that russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on hillary clinton based on bugged conversations she had on various visits to russia and intercepted phone calls 
the former intelligence officer says the response from the fbi was shock and horror the fbi after receiving the first memo did not immediately request additional material according to the former intelligence officer and his american associates yet in august they say the fbi asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources the former spy forwarded to the bureau several memossome of which referred to members of trumps inner circle after that point he continued to share information with the fbi its quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on he says 
in august corn reports the fbi asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he continued to share information with the fbi which he says made it clear there was a pretty substantial inquiry going on 
if this report is accurate the spys information confirms what senator harry reid says intelligence experts and fbi director james comey already shared with him regarding explosive information regarding ties and coordination between donald trump and russia 
this report also rings true given report about the trump server repeatedly being connected to russia including trumps server possibly communicating with a russian bank 
it also makes sense given the many ties to russia within trumps own campaign and indeed trumps own rhetoric regarding nato and russia trump changed the republican party platforms proukraine proposals and talked about weakening nato both of which mirrored putins wish list nbc reported monday evening that the fbi is in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps excampaign managers connection to russia 
donald trump has already been busted for reading russian propaganda at his rallies as newsweeks kurt eichenwald uncovered an instance of trump reading propaganda directly from putin at a rally in pennsylvania 
eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the russians have been hacking into american emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election the russians have been obtaining american emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of themfalsifying themin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election the big question of course is why are the russians working so hard to damage clinton and in the process aid donald trump 
the answer to why putin is trying so hard to defeat clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her unlike donald trump hillary clinton is no pushover according to former us officials putin sees clinton as a forceful proponent of regime change policies that the russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival 
trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the kremlin hes been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy he is easily flattered and easily manipulated its also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him  see the billy bush bus tape of trump bragging about sexual assault trump is easy bait 
the fact that the fbi director felt compelled to announce something about hillarys emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aides emails and even then he wasnt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates but he chose to keep this explosive information about donald trumps ties to russia under wraps is very disturbing 
this isnt a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the fbi follows about ongoing investigations this is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate but the fact that they come from different sources and that trump willingly staffed his own campaign with russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak  these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-07-07T163623Z_1_LYNXNPEC6616G_RTROPTP_4_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON-COMEY.jpg,bias,Real,trump supporter jailed trying rig election committing voter fraud,letter james comey hillary clinton email scandal motivated democrats clinton campaign says raised million online last hours lisa lerer ap reported clinton campaign says theyve raised online last hrs since clinton became nominee convention lisa lerer llerer november comey letter supposed boost trump depress democratic turnout opposite appears happening james comeys interference presidential election motivated clinton supporters work harder give money get polls republicans wanted democrats seen comeys letter republican spin october surprise failed instead made hillary clinton even stronger giving campaign resources use close presidential election political tactic comey letter harming republicans republicans thrown everything think hillary clinton nothing stopped hillary clinton supporters continue grow stronger donald trump marching back reality television star clist celebrity obscurity,1.0

André du Pôle,2016-11-19T04:00:00.000+02:00,men are binded by their shared realization of truth,"home  badge abuse  cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party matt agorist november   leave a comment 
lincolnton nc  time and again police prove that the government having a monopoly on the use of weapons is a terrible idea a glaring example of this incompetence is evidenced through a recent case in north carolina in which a police officer shot her own daughter 
on monday the lincoln county sheriffs office announced that deputy misty michelle flowers  was terminated after she shot her yearold daughter over the weekend 
the shooting happened as flowers who is entrusted by the state to act responsibly with a firearm was showing off her service weapon to friends saturday night when she squeezed the trigger the bullet then went through the wall and hit her daughter in another room 
i find gross negligence and the disregard for the safety of others was displayed in the incident saturday night and therefore officer flowers was terminated today sheriff david carpenter said this is totally separate from the sbi investigation into the incident that occurred at her residence 
according to wncn 
lincoln county deputies said they were called to the home at  pm and started tending to the girls injury the child was taken to chslincoln and then airlifted to carolinas medical center in charlotte for surgery according to deputies she was in stable condition after treatment 
neighbors say there was a halloween party going on at the house where this happened 
flowers has been with the lincoln county sheriffs office since  and worked for the catawba county sheriffs office before that 
during this entire situation my focus has been on the wellbeing and condition of the child involved and am of the understanding the child is going to be ok after the surgery this is a very tragic situation for all involved the officer her family her career and everyone that has been touched by this carpenter said we continue to pray for healing of the child and the entire family as the investigation continues over the next several days 
according to the sbi an investigation into the incident is still ongoing it is unclear whether or not flowers will face any charges 
this is the second such incident in only a week in which a police officer accidentally fired their weapon endangering the lives of children last week the free thought project reported on the ohio cop who fired his weapon into a daycare center while it was fully occupied 
despite the officer clearly admitting to committing the misdemeanor offense of discharging a firearm within city limits police have yet to charge him 
right now our law department has it and they are reviewing it to see if there should be any charges police chief jack davis said last wednesday morning 
it was a very unfortunate incident for the school as well as him he added 
outside of skating out of the misdemeanor charge so far this officer also seems to be avoiding the felony offense of discharging a weapon in a gunfree school zone 
imagine for a moment that you were showing off your pistol to friends at a halloween party and all of the sudden you accidentally squeeze off a round and shoot your own daughter 
there are two possible scenarios that would take place the first one being that a swat team responds and you are killed the second less lethal result would be your inevitable arrest and charges of public endangerment unlawful discharge illegal use of a firearm assault with a deadly weapon terrorism or a myriad of other charges associated with sending a deadly projectile hurling through a wall and into a child you would immediately be facing fines jail time probation and firearms restrictions 
however if you are a government agent whos trusted with carrying a deadly weapon into places others cannot you neednt worry about any of those repercussions matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share",english,returnofkings.com,No Image URL,hate,Real,women hate female objectification longer profit,home badge abuse cop caught body camera stealing money unconscious crash victim cop caught body camera stealing money unconscious crash victim matt agorist november comment denver co denver cop arrested suspended without pay body camera footage caught stealing cash crash victim instead helping unconscious crash victim officer julian archuleta took advantage situation personal gain going mans clothing robbing archuleta faces charges misdemeanor theft stdegree official misconduct tampering physical evidence according arrest affidavit archuleta responded call shots fired early morning hours october call led short pursuit ended car crashed driver got away passenger vehicle knocked unconscious archuletas body camera recorded officer next minutes seconds footage took pictures scene searched mans clothing removed paramedics video archuleta finds stack cash mans pants bill top according arrest affidavit separates bill stack bill remains top throughout footage archuleta shuffles money rearranges paperwork patrol car affidavit said according denver post detective collected cash logged property bureau evidence counted find bills affidavit said reviewing archuletas body camera footage part investigation detective noticed bill amazingly enough instead covering theft detective crossed thin blue line reported inconsistency bill internal affairs confronted investigators archuleta told would check war bag see money slipped crevice patrol car according arrest affidavit archuleta called detective back hour later claimed found bills must fallen bag caught redhanded archuleta turned money according post denver district attorneys office declined prosecute shooting suspect missing cash archuleta allegedly moved evidence inside suspects vehicle detectives search warrant affidavit said earlier year denver police department equipped body cameras know took long department adopt archuleta go history first denver cop criminally charged based body camera evidence like cases police theft incident isolated fact months ago grants police department sgt roshern c mckinney arrested investigation found hed stolen money marijuana police department like archuleta entire theft captured officers body camera mckinney since charged marijuana distribution conspiracy felony embezzlement state police also charged mckinneys yearold girlfriend tanicka gallegosgonzales drug distribution conspiracy arrested albuquerque booked sandoval county detention center according kob public information officer new mexico state police elizabeth armijo said grants police chief craig vandiver alerted state police department found video mckinneys lapel camera exposed possible illicit activity grants police department sergeant say criminal tendency police officers unable practice restraint theft knowing recorded share google kali whrite boi ok cool corrupt criminal cops still msm puppet infuriating civilian fleeing scene shots fired leading cop short chase crashing stupid msm puppets,0.0

with millions of eyes watching cnn for election results tonight the network really couldnt afford any highprofile screwups but unfortunately thats exactly what they got when john king tapped his touchscreen electoral map too hard and plunged himself straight into a digital hellscape from which there seems to be no escape 
ouch thats some major egg on cnns face 
the night appeared to be going smoothly in the networks washington studio until king tried to zoom in on a breakdown map of crucial ohio swing districts when the map seemed to freeze up a frustrated king tapped the magic wall with enough force that his whole arm plunged through the suddenly fluid surface of the screen before wolf blitzer or anderson cooper could step in he had been fully engulfed in a vast virtual expanse of colorful swirling data 
with millions of americans tuning in to watch the results of this historic election cnn has been forced to press on even as they try to free john king from the computerized map a noticeably emotional wolf blitzer mouthed the words im sorry to his imprisoned colleague before tapping the board to call up a gender breakdown of likely oregon voters the bar graph of which animated right into john kings spine launching nearly all the way to the midatlantic states if cnn producers thought that they had stabilized the situation by urging king to take refuge in the bottom corner of the screen it did not take long for them to realize how wrong they were when connecticut was called for hillary clinton the trapped john king was also turned entirely blue and let loose a horrible scream as if he were being burned alive this level of panic was matched moments later when king tried to fend off a ravenous piece of malware with just his loafer only for the shoe to shatter into pixels that the code devoured 
yikes cnn will be wondering for a while how this all went so wrong and on their biggest night too 
with plenty of states left to declare tonight theres still time for king to be rescued from the computerized nightmare but with uploading a jpeg of a ladder for him to climb up and trying to shepherd him onto a thumb drive having already failed to return king to the studio cnn may be running out of options

beverly hills calif  more than  of hillary clintons biggest donors crowded into the home of casey and laura wasserman here on thursday night each having written a check for at least  to snag a ticket the hollywood glitterati in attendance  elton john performed on the piano barbra streisand mingled in the crowd  were sending her off for the home stretch of the campaign with north of  million in fresh funding 
it was a fitting capstone to a remarkable  months for clinton on the lucrative california fundraising circuit this final event anchored by a host committee of billionaires hollywood executives media moguls and tech investors  sean parker jeffrey katzenberg haim saban chris sacca  that each directed  to clintons efforts 
clinton calls them her hillblazers campaign bundlers who have given or raised at least  for her campaign and she has erected an unparalleled and unprecedented infrastructure of  such people  nearly double the number of any past presidential candidate including president obama four years ago 
while clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors it is these bundlers in more than  states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation combined this elite andup club has amassed a minimum of  million for clinton and the democratic party  and the actual figure is likely far far higher than that the biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns 
we had the best base of donors and bundlers and raisers ever in  it was even better in  and its much better in  than  said wade randlett a san franciscobased democrat who has raised money for clinton obama and democratic causes for decades the obama people basically  percent in are favor of hillary theres really no loss because of ideology or bad blood and she has added an enormous number of people especially women 
among her bundlers are celebrities will smith and sports stars earvin magic johnson hollywood directors steven spielberg and george lucas and corporate executives marissa mayer and sheryl sandberg wall streettypes marc lasry media executives haim saban and anna wintour and members of congress including her running mate sen tim kaine who helped raise more than  for clinton before he joined the ticket in july 
the clinton campaign said  percent of its bundlers are women 
there are also federal lobbyists from whom the democratic party under obama refused to accept money a prohibition that has since been rolled back 
this club has expanded to the point where clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom as of the end of june she counted  such individuals and couples by the end of july it was  on august  it was  
it includes billionaires george soros warren buffett and tom steyer super lobbyists like steve elmendorf and boldfaced names like calvin klein and jj abrams there is also a sprinkling of longtime clinton family advisers such as vernon jordan",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14774994921475744757e-800x454.png,conspiracy,Fake,isis declares kill palestinians one one yet remains quiet israel,email beverly hills calif hillary clintons biggest donors crowded home casey laura wasserman thursday night written check least snag ticket hollywood glitterati attendance elton john performed piano barbra streisand mingled crowd sending home stretch campaign north million fresh funding fitting capstone remarkable months clinton lucrative california fundraising circuit final event anchored host committee billionaires hollywood executives media moguls tech investors sean parker jeffrey katzenberg haim saban chris sacca directed clintons efforts clinton calls hillblazers campaign bundlers given raised least campaign erected unparalleled unprecedented infrastructure people nearly double number past presidential candidate including president obama four years ago clinton advisers like tout small online donors bundlers states four foreign countries form true backbone financial operation combined elite andup club amassed minimum million clinton democratic party actual figure likely far far higher biggest bundlers typically collect millions campaigns best base donors bundlers raisers ever even better much better said wade randlett san franciscobased democrat raised money clinton obama democratic causes decades obama people basically percent favor hillary theres really loss ideology bad blood added enormous number people especially women among bundlers celebrities smith sports stars earvin magic johnson hollywood directors steven spielberg george lucas corporate executives marissa mayer sheryl sandberg wall streettypes marc lasry media executives haim saban anna wintour members congress including running mate sen tim kaine helped raise clinton joined ticket july clinton campaign said percent bundlers women also federal lobbyists democratic party obama refused accept money prohibition since rolled back club expanded point clinton would struggle fit bundlers single ballroom end june counted individuals couples end july august includes billionaires george soros warren buffett tom steyer super lobbyists like steve elmendorf boldfaced names like calvin klein jj abrams also sprinkling longtime clinton family advisers vernon jordan,1.0
Kshatriya Indransha,2016-10-30T21:00:00.000+02:00,how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society,"buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression aaron clarey 
captain capitalism is the resident economist of the manoandrosphere he is a misanthropic hedonist nihilistic cynical type but he keeps getting proved right every day he is the author of  enjoy the decline   worthless  and  bachelor pad economics  his newest book is  the black mans guide out of poverty  he also runs the advisory  asshole consulting  you can read his daily rantings at his blog captain capitalism  november   masculinity 
buzz aldrin and neil armstrong are household names because they were the first men to land on the moon and while neil is perhaps the moreremembered of the two because he was technically the first to land on the moon buzz is just as remembered because of his unique name while i bet most of you dont know who the third guy was but technicalities of who landed where first and who had cool names aside buzz aldrin will forever be one of the worlds greatest historical figures because of his unrivaled accomplishments and will die a better man than the vast majority of us 
but did you know buzz aldrin was an alcoholic and after retiring he fell into a severe depression and after his divorce his days consisted of drinking alone in his apartment fetching kfc and booze until he entered rehab 
its a hard fact to believe where a man who seems to have everything fame a superaccomplished career and least of all the titaniumstrong professionalism and selfdiscipline to become an astronaut yet he ends up down depressed drunk and perhaps even suicidal like any other ordinary piece of trailer trash but while it doesnt make sense at first and you cant see how this relates to you realize theres a very good and simple reason for this fall from great heights the buzz aldrin syndrome 
understand as we use the internet to accumulate the wisdom and knowledge to rocket past our contemporaries and excel in life a problem is festering that you are unaware of additionally much like alzheimers it is not prevalent today but as humans advance more and live longer it will become increasingly common therefore we have the option to identify it today prepare for it now and thus avoid the pain and insanity that comes with having a problem we cant identify 
or 
we can have it devastate our lives later 
it is the buzz aldrin syndrome 
the buzz aldrin syndrome is where a man achieves such greatness such accomplishments in life that he is truly unrivaled and peerless while exhilarating at first perhaps even earning one fame riches and fortune the success also unintentionally alienates the person from the rest of society at the time buzz aldrin only had three or four other astronauts who he could really talk to confide in and relate to the remaining  billion people on the planet at the time were just starstruck wideeyed sheep alas buzz aldrin could be surrounded by scores of fans at a party but still be completely alone mentally 
the syndrome is also exacerbated as ones pinnacle achievements in life are likely correlated with retirement you typically progress in your career right up until the day you retire however here you leave the environment and network youve come accustomed thrived in and derived your entire agency from thus in a very short period of time you go from the center of attention the life of the party the engine of the machineto a retiree in california drinking scotch and eating kfc longing for the days you could go back to the office again without the environment you derived all your worth and value from you lose purpose in life you lose mental stimulation you lose your peers and very likely sink into a crippling depression the perfect storm 
there are seven factors that when combined create the perfect storm for the buzz aldrin syndrome to form and most rok readers either have these traits are affected by them  technological advancements 
technology has always advanced but in this particular case it affects us in two specific ways making living expenses cheaper and allowing for more and easier ways to make money 
as opposed to the s most of a mans life was spent toiling in the field he didnt have time to contemplate loftier or heavier subjects much like the purpose of life what is mans reason for being etc you had to worry about the plague tetanus your wife dying in labor and whether thered be enough crops to survive the coming winter but today through economics capitalism agricultural technology etc a single man can basically eat for nearfree at walmart or the local grocery store 
technology has also freed us from work not so much from the fact we have to work but in terms of how much time we need to spend on it in order to survive no more than a decade ago a young man had to work  hours a week  for a commute and likely for an inept baby boomer boss who was never going to let you get past the cubicle plantation now with the internet not only can a man give the proverbial finger to rush hour and a commute but his boss as well making whatever minimalistic modicum of money he needs to survive through online entrepreneurship in short it has never been easier to satisfy maslows first three and vital hierarchy of needs freeing a mans mind to pursue his own excellence not to mention ponder his point and purpose in being here  minimalism 
it is no secret that red pill men practice or at least pursue minimalism we know that material things do not matter as it is the love and friendship from our fellow man friends family and loved ones that matter most you know that it would be nice to have that shelby super snake mustang but youd never trade it in for a lifetime of conversations and cigars with your best friend additionally we value our freedom above all else and refuse to subjugate ourselves to becoming debt slaves by buying things we plain dont need 
jettisoning these material desires liberates more of our finite lives from work and a commute to once again pursue our passions our fields our adventures and our lives in simply refusing to buy a mcmansion and take on a car loan we guarantee we will live more interesting and rewarding lives than  of our peers  avoiding divorce and unwanted children 
further saving us more time is the disproportionate number of us refusing to have children or marry in fear of divorce and for those of us who do marry we are fully aware of what to look for more or less immunizing us from divorce  knowledge of women 
to be blunt and honestly assess the good the manosphere and red pill community have done we have saved the lives of millions of young men and prevented older ones from wasting what remains of theirs if i were to estimate it every boy born today will save at least a decade of time that would have otherwise been wasted at nightclubs chasing tail dating the wrong girls and perhaps even marrying the wrong ones 
being a product of the s i have often talked with my gen x peers where we estimated what we could have done had we not wasted the s and s chasing women we were either never going to get or would regret catching we could have easily had doctorates houses built by our own hands much better careers not to mention better mental health as we would have avoided all the batshit insane women we sifted through young men today especially those who consume the red pill will easily have a decade of time on us by simply learning from our mistakes   selfimprovement 
unless you are in the virgintow community you know how important selfimprovement is to a mans life you have this one finite life on this planet and not only is it imperative you enjoy it but you must ensure it is a masterpiece of art in whatever endeavors you choose to excel in this may not land you on the moon but you will achieve greatness and excellence in some capacity or another music literature innovation philosophy being a good dad something you will not idly stand by sitting on your ass majoring in sociology or collecting a welfare check as you knock up baby mama after baby momma you will be notable and leave a positive legacy on this world  entrepreneurship or stem 
most of you know not to major in stupid worthless shit  you also know that for the majority of us entrepreneurship or selfemployment is the only form of employment that we can tolerate because of this two things will happen in your life one you will save an inordinate amount of time spent trying to make a go at a career that just isnt in demand in the real world you will work as an engineer a programmer a doctor or some real professiontrade which will not only pay you a handsome wage but make your life incredibly easier two at some point in time you will come up with an idea that will either cement your success in your career or outright launch a successful entrepreneurial endeavor this will free you from your dependence on traditional employers ensure your financial future is sound but it will also likely lead towards you achieving your legacy in excellence 
in the veritable sea of liberal arts majors not one of their millions will ever make anything of themselves they will simply waste away doubling down on masters degrees and doctorates in their hopelessly worthless fields worse they will be crippled until death with student loans and inadequate compensation as they beg and vote for other peoples money they will die like most unmentionable irrelevant and forgotten 
you will not  a high intelligence 
to make all of this a reality you need the raw intellectual capacity to bring this to fruition while no studies have been done if you have the independent mindedness to be reading rok id estimate the average iq of rok readers to be  however keep in mind while being highly intelligent is an asset it is also a curse  like rok you are on the fringe and because of that you are not only going to receive an inordinate amount of flak from the rest of normie society but relating to the rest of it let alone finding a healthy and rewarding social life in it is going to prove next to impossible 
when you combine these traits and conditions you have what is arguably the perfect environment for a great life to form you need very little to survive because you wont waste your resources on frivolous material things in life you also have very little liabilities or responsibilities not only because youre a minimalist but are likely not going to marry or have children the lions share of your time and energies can be dedicated towards achieving excellence and greatness in your life 
and if youve done it right youll be two decades ahead of your gen x peers since you avoided worthless degrees and leapfrogged your philosophical understanding of life you will be accomplished you will be successful you will have paid a fraction of the mental toll to get there and you will indeed be an amazing man the worlds most interesting perhaps you have reached the so called finish line much earlier and faster than buzz aldrin 
and thats when your real problems start you werent meant to be here 
understand that while the goal of man was to secure unlimited food resources and security so that he may pursue an unlimited and happy life the human mind has no experience being here the entire existence of humankind has been struggle suffering fighting and striving for such a life but also   of the time failing  and over the course of human history the human brain has had  million years experience and conditioning in failure not success 
this leads to an ironic and perhaps the most tragic instances in human experiences a man finally gets what he wants wealth health success excellence legacy everything but upon attaining it he cant enjoy it because the human mind is not programmed to he not only realizes this rare success doesnt result in happiness or a perpetual lifelong glee that will see him to his grave but theres nothing left to conquer theres nothing left to do the game of life is over and like red dead redemption it gets mighty boring just riding your horse around after you conquer the game 
worse because of the unique characteristics required to attain this excellence any man lucky enough to be this successful is in one way or another ostracized from the rest of his peers professionally romantically intellectually some way or another to be in that   you have to be a statistical freak alas you get to suffer the true symptoms of the buzz aldrin syndrome 
peerlessness  while your friends are pumping out children or your colleagues are trying to get out from underneath their mcmansion mortgage and impending divorce you may be avoiding these dreaded fates but you are also alone no longer are these the college days where your intellectual peers in equal lifecircumstances can hang out chat philosophize and in numbers that seem endless slowly but surely they will get picked off like german messerschmitts in wwii by the forces of life and you will be left alone 
understand this has nothing to do with your pursuit of greatness or achieving excellence in life but is outside of your control as these people fall within the bell distribution curve of averageness they choose these lives meaning its not the statistical freak leaving them but them leaving the statistical freak no matter how loudly they claimed in college they were going to live life differently and dont think that you can simply recoup your former social life by joining them by being average putting on a sports jersey ordering some buffalo wild wings cheering on the local sportsball team your mind wont tolerate it 
you are peerless get used to it 
boredom  without people you get bored no matter how intelligent you are you are still human and humans are indeed social creatures as they derive their entire life value from others not things but the paradox those suffering from the buzz aldrin syndrome face is that while you would like to be social with people the vast majority of people are either too common too stupid or just too boring especially when compared to being by yourself 
go to that same buffalo wild wings to hear loud drunk divorced swpl men in their s cheer on the local swingystick team 
or read marcus aurelius  
go to a movie where jason bourne discovers another mole in the ciaagainwho set up his fatheragainwhere he drives around europe shooting the place upagain 
or binge on some history podcasts  
i know how about you go to a party where youll hear the same conversations from men about the sportsball game they just saw at buffalo wild wings as they lament their inability to get out from underneath their mortgage while the wives gossip about their painfully pointless governmentmakework careers while talking about how great the cake is 
or road trip out west and do some hiking in the desert 
the larger point is not only are the vast majority of people not intellectually stimulating enough but good luck finding enough of them who have the freedom and finances to do anything besides hit up happy hour when wifey lets them out of the house 
and then theres 
frustration  being unencumbered by the daily scourge of chores children finances mortgages and commutes your mind will be unshackled to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits it wishes to pursue youll solve world problems in an afternoon that politicians are taking eons to not solve youll come up with some and many viable business ideas discarding most of them because you have not the time to put them all into execution youll see the obvious solutions to making your friends and love ones lives infinitely better but theyll have the horseblinders on so tight theyll ignore your wisdom or youll make a great scientific discovery at work while your boss dismisses it away and threatens to fire you for having an independent thought it is simply the real world telling you you dont control everything and matter of fact most of this world was not meant for you 
obviously you can see where depression alcoholism and ennui set in you can see where the pursuit and successful attainment of excellence in life can lead to unintentional alienation and ostracization from the rest of society and since society is where all humans  geniuses or not successful or not  get their value you can see the downside to zooming past the finish line of life especially at increasingly earlier ages as technology and minimalism permit it 
the solution is in part to find quality people who can be lifelong friends colleagues peers and comrades perhaps even get married if you find the right girl and no matter what keep yourself and your mind occupied hobbies interests pursuits etc inactivity is death but ultimately what is going to best prepare you for whats coming is to simply know its coming 
nirvana and heaven are not at the other side of that finish line an active and rewarding social life full of close friends and loved ones are the not the reward for success and it certainly isnt a

Kit Daniels,2016-10-27T18:25:45.168+03:00,podesta who told hillary she could use private email,"three quarters of americans oppose gun control record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban steve watson  infowarscom  october   comments 
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

that answer is in according to the wall street journal  which says they are turning away that the republican nominee faces vocal backlash from evangelical women over lewd comments and sexualmisconduct allegations

it isnt as if trump hasnt been saying these things all along as david french protested at the national review back in june trump subverts all of our most cherished values the question is what took them so long 
trump has already had an effect on the religious right an unrepentant sinner who represents everything they claim to oppose he has  percent support from evangelical men but while evangelical women seem to support him despite his misogyny there are good reasons to suspect the men support him because of his negative attitude towards women

Luke Stranahan,2016-11-17T00:39:38.023+02:00,things i learned from being my own general contractor,"why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money by   th  
if donald trump truly wants to fix the economy he must shut down the federal reserve if he just tries to patch up our current system he will fail because it has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning a little over a century ago very powerful forces on wall street convinced congress to completely restructure our financial system an immensely powerful central bank known as the federal reserve was created and the goal was to transform the us dollar into a debtbased currency that would continuously be inflated and to create an endless debt spiral from which   could never possibly escape sadly they were successful on both counts since the creation of the federal reserve the value of the us dollar has declined by approximately  percent and our national debt has gotten more than  times larger  
americans tend to give most of the credit or most of the blame for the performance of the us economy to our presidents but the truth is that an unelected unaccountable group of central bankers has far more power over our economy than anyone else does the federal reserve has become known as  the fourth branch of government  but unlike the other branches of government we are told that the feds decisions are above politics because they are too important fed officials fiercely guard their independence and they fiercely resist any interference from congress the president or the american people 
donald trump can try to lower taxes and reduce regulations but what he will be able to do to influence the economy pales in comparison to the immensely powerful tools that the fed wields the fed controls interest rates the fed controls the money supply and the fed regulates the banks 
to give you an idea of how enormously powerful the fed is i want you to pull out a dollar bill 
as you look at that dollar bill i want you to notice that it says federal reserve note right at the top 
in the financial world a note is an instrument of debt and the truth is that our system was designed to create as much debt as possible 
so why are we using debtbased federal reserve notes in the first place shouldnt congress have control over our currency 
according to article i section  of the us constitution  it is congress that has the authority to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures 
so how did the fed get involved 
well it is a very long and convoluted story and if you are interested in the history behind it i would commend to you an excellent book by c edward griffin entitled  the creature from jekyll island a second look at the federal reserve  basically big money interests on wall street got their hooks into the white house and congress and they rushed through legislation right before christmas in  that created this insidious central banking system that was designed to slowly but surely take wealth from the american people and put it into their hands 
sadly most americans dont even realize that we have a debtbased currency nor do they understand where our money comes from in a previous article  i discussed how money is normally created by the federal reserve under our current system 
when the us government decides that it wants to spend another billion dollars that it does not have it does not print up a billion dollars 
rather the us government creates a bunch of us treasury bonds debt and takes them over to the federal reserve 
the federal reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the us treasury bonds 
the federal reserve takes the us treasury bonds that it receives in exchange for the federal reserve notes that it gave to the government and it auctions off those bonds to the highest bidder  but of course this process always creates more debt than it does money 
the us treasury bonds that the federal reserve receives in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned off through the federal reserve system 
but wait 
there is a problem 
because the us government must pay interest on the treasury bonds the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater than the amount of money that has been created 
so where will the us government get the money to pay that debt 
well the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the economy really really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt 
but that never actually happens does it 
and the creators of the federal reserve understood this as well they understood that the us government would not have enough money to both run the government and service the national debt they knew that the us government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an attempt to keep up with the game 
so our debt just keeps going up and up and up while barack obama has been in the white house our national debt has risen by more than  trillion dollars and at this moment it is sitting just under the  trillion dollar mark  
but we shouldnt be surprised by this because this is precisely what the federal reserve system was designed to do to us 
many conservatives still hold to the mistaken illusion that we could somehow pay all of this debt back someday but as i have shown in a previous article this is mathematically impossible to do  
if the government went out today and grabbed every single dollar in existence we could not pay back the national debt and of course we have   of household debt   of corporate debt and   of state and local government debt that we need to pay back as well 
under the current system our only hope is to keep the wheel spinning by continuing to devalue the dollar and by continuing to go into even greater amounts of debt 
and of course it isnt just the united states that is in this predicament at this point almost every single nation on the entire planet has a central bank 
even though there are extremely sharp disagreements among nations on virtually everything else somehow central banking has achieved nearly universal adoption 
as you read this article well over  of the population of the globe lives in a country that has a central bank 
do you think that is just a coincidence 
of course there are still a few very small countries such as the federated states of micronesia that do not have a central bank but the only big nation not to have one is north korea 
and you would literally have to be insane to want to live in north korea 
but now we have an opportunity to get free from this insidious system the truth is that we dont have to have a central bank in fact the greatest period of economic growth in us history was when there was no central bank  
we dont need central planners to set our interest rates and to manipulate our money supply they will never admit this but the reality of the matter is that their interference in the economy often creates tremendous economic busts 
since the federal reserve was created in  there have been  distinct recessions or depressions                    
considering their track record isnt it time for a change 
and we dont have to have a debtbased currency in fact not too long ago we had a president that decided to start issuing debtfree united states notes 
back in  president john f kennedy issued executive order  which authorized the us treasury to issue debtfree united states notes which were directly created by the us government 
he was assassinated shortly thereafter 
most americans dont realize this but many of the debtfree united states notes that were issued under president kennedy are still in circulation today  and president trump could do something similar 
but will he 
it has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender and the federal reserve system has turned all of us into debt slaves 
debt is a form of social control and the global elite use all of this debt to dominate the planet the total amount of debt in the world just hit   of  trillion dollars  and the longer we allow the central banks to control the system the bigger this debt bubble will become 
  here in the united states that starts with shutting   issuing debtfree currency it would take someone very bold to make a move like this and so let us hope that the man that we just elected is up to the task",english,returnofkings.com,No Image URL,hate,Real,camp saints predicted migrant destruction europe,americans shall say peace safety michael snyder november st millions americans expecting new golden age america donald trump going get always optimism new president elected dont know ever seen anything like euphoria many trump supporters expressing right look voted donald trump want successful possible donald trump becomes next president january th mean great problems nation facing somehow magically disappear listen people make sound like america going experience nothing peace prosperity blessing decades come would love indeed going case unfortunately simply truth currently path leads national suicide unless change ways isnt going matter white house keep hearing new president going unify nation going extremely difficult considering fact divided ever fact brand new gallup survey found alltime record high percent americans believe greatly divided comes important values keep hearing entering golden age peace prosperity supposed happen still butchering millions innocent children abortion mills keep hearing economy take like rocket possible already greatest debt binge world history way able maintain massively inflated debtfueled standard living piling debt faster pace generation history today accumulated trillion dollars consumer debt corporate debt doubled since last financial crisis national debt rapidly approaching trillion dollars trump possibly pump standard living debt obama already done keep hearing going make america great great producing pornography rest world combined keep hearing law order going restored meanwhile chaos already erupting cities nation far left planning turn inauguration day major riot keep hearing things going go back way used discussed previous article sexuallytransmitted diseases spreading fastest pace decades percentage births wedlock times higher approximately two every three christian men watch pornography regular basis keep hearing going drain swamp yet plans even reform federal reserve system heart financial problems nation keep hearing good judges going put supreme court trust new president said fine supreme court decision forced states redefine institution marriage keep hearing going example rest world example every form evil imaginable exploding popularity inside country keep hearing government going blessed government gives hundreds millions dollars year planned parenthood blessed republicans control white house senate house representatives golden opportunity defund planned parenthood doesnt happen probably never happen show complete utter failure republican party become remember planned parenthood organization caught camera admitting harvest organs babies kill sell organs highest bidder would argue america already great lot things united states number one world television watching legal drug use illegal drug use lead world plastic surgery eating disorder deaths teen pregnancy lawyers per capita highest std infection rate industrialized world highest divorce rate industrialized world largest prison population entire planet also complicated tax system entire world largest trade deficit entire world largest national debt entire world want make america great sure lot work complacency seeing right really alarms many people seem think battle donald trump victorious election night even close reality fundamentally change course nation survive tinkering tax rates regulations trade agreements going get job done many people acting cuts scratches reality country really needs major heart surgery donald trump sort messiah even able accomplish every single thing promising right nearly enough moment millions americans proclaiming peace safety donald trump election shall see turns november st tags americans anxiety blessing donald trump national suicide peace safety successful suicide trump category commentary set higher interest rates major recession giant stock market crash,0.0

in an interview with bill oreilly on thursday donald trump was again asked about the access hollywood tape in which the republican nominee was caught bragging about sexually assaulting women this time though he put up a new defense strategy at least when it comes to this particular issue  blame the microphone 
when asked by oreilly if he thinks he would be winning the election if not for the release of the video trump once again repeated that it was only locker room talk and then started complaining that a microphone shouldnt have been allowed to capture his comments 
shockingly he did not express any regrets for his language

its amazing how often a microphone can be the root of a presidential candidates troubles 
it should also be noted that trumps complaint about his dressing room privacy being breached is particularly rich given his history of storming into the dressing rooms of teenage pageant contestants some as young as  years old 
when asked by oreilly if he would take legal action against nbcs role in uncovering and releasing the tape trump said youll see 
all of this comes after trump recently promised to sue the growing number of women who have come forward saying that they were sexually assaulted by him

video 
clinton said 
hillary clinton could probably spend  hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting trumps hypocrisies 
while trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new dc hotel hillary clinton was winning more early votes in the state of florida there are two competing messages in the media currently about the election the first message is that democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting the second message is that a few state polls have shown trump leading by a little in florida and gaining ground in new hampshire 
it is possible that both of these stories are correct democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news some republicans may be coming back to trump 
the important thing for hillary clinton and democrats is not to let up democrats are very close to generation defining win but victory is not sealed yet more polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend but the polls may not matter 
if most of the ballots in states like north carolina and florida are cast before election day the polls may end up meaning very little 
hillary clinton is in a great position but judging from her own remarks she is still working hard to close the deal on november

russian president vladimir putin has dismissed as hysteria claims by us officials that moscow is trying to influence the upcoming presidential election in america 
speaking to foreign policy experts during a valdai discussion club meeting in sochi southern russia on thursday putin said washington was using russia as a distraction to cover up the fact that this years white house contenders had nothing to offer on real issues 
hysteria has been whipped up in the united states about the influence of russia over the us presidential election putin said adding that so far no clear policies have been offered by the us political elite to tackle issues such as national debt and gun control 
american officials and intelligence agencies have openly accused the kremlin of sponsoring hacking attacks against the us 
this is while democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton and her campaign have gone even further claiming that russia was trying to rig the november election in favor of republican nominee donald trump us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton l and republican nominee donald trump 
during the last presidential debate last week clinton accused trump of having secret ties with moscow saying that putin would love to see a puppet president in the white house 
its much simpler to distract people with socalled russian hackers spies and agents of influence does anyone really think that russia could influence the american peoples choice in any way is america a banana republic or what putin asked in his thursday speech 
baffled by the release of a series of hacked emails that have uncovered the inner mechanics of the democratic partys campaign for the election the white house has stepped up its antirussian rhetoric american officials have even threatened russia with countermeasures 
despite the general belief however trump has on many occasions called on russiaaccusers to either provide their evidence or stop making baseless assumptions about moscow 
i dont know if theyre behind it and i think its public relations frankly the realestate mogul said wednesday do you know what bothers me i have nothing to do with russia

the months long dakota access keystone xl pipleine protest at the standing rock indian reservation by native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs  tear gas tazers  and even live ammunition  killing horses  while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up 
but as the saying goes water is life  and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for 
the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project

a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in  with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about  miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners 
forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at  billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons  but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead  source  
shockingly in  the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  million pipeline project  
according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans  source  
this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here  
most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a  mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the  mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete  mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region 
with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a  year term as  of the  commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the  in campaign contributions abbott received from warren 
footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device  lrad  crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th  final thoughts 
warren is listed as number  on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion in september of  he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake 
if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors  including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis

one thing that has continuously dogged the donald trump for president campaign is the fact that racists antisemites xenophobes misogynists and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign no matter how much trumps people try to say he doesnt want the support of such folks the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously so naturally when trumps campaign manager kellyanne conway sat down with an interview with cnns jake tapper on sunday  that particular issue came up again of course conway was not happy tapper began 
there are a lot of antisemites and racists and misogynists who support the trump candidacy 
conway immediately went on defense saying wow tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting jewsa at the press pen at a recent trump rally and directly asked conway if she would refer to such people as deplorable she responded 
yes i would wow i have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe  i hope youve been to trump rallies and i hope that youve seen the tens of thousands i mean hes had over half a million people easily i think in excess of that these are usaloving americans 
tapper went on to say that no he isnt putting all trump supporters into that camp but went on to force conways hand on this one 
but without question people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are antisemitic that has been offered to people who are antisemitic and racists and on and on and these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting mr trump 
mr trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and antisemitic fans tapper continued he just has he says things like oh sure i disavow i disavow but he has never serious said i dont want the support of those people they are reprehensible they have nothing to do with me he has never seriously done it 
conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the trump campaign is winning saying 
i think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence i have that were actually going to win in nine days because the idea that were going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that hillary clinton would bring to the oval office in such an important week 
no kellyanne its not a sign that trump is winning its pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began that donald trump is a raging bigot and he has been so openly dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle and its all because of donald trump he embraces these bigots because hes one of them the quicker you learn that the better

many political commentators credit donald trumps rise to white voters antipathy toward racial and ethnic minorities however we believe this focus on racial resentment obscures another important aspect of racial thinking 
in a study of white americans attitudes and candidate preferences we found that trumps success reflects the rise of white identity politicsan attempt to protect the collective interests of white voters via the ballot box whereas racial prejudice refers to animosity toward other racial groups white identity reflects a sense of connection to fellow white americans 
were not the first to tie trumps candidacy to white identity politics  but our data provide some of the clearest evidence that ongoing demographic changes in the united states are increasing white racial identity white identity in turn is pushing white americans to support trump 
white identity 
when we talk about white identity were not referring to the altright fringe the white nationalist movement or others who espouse racist beliefs rather were talking about everyday white americans who perhaps for the first time are racially conscious 
snip 
nonhispanic whites are projected to become a minority in the year  this increasing diversity across the country is making whites own race harder and harder to ignore snip 
trump and white identity politics 
as whites increasingly sense that their status in society is falling  white racial identity is becoming politicized trumps promise to make america great again speaks to these anxieties by recalling a past in which white people dominated every aspect of politics and society snip 
snip 
to test our ideas about trump and white identity politics we surveyed a nationally representative sample of about  white americans the survey covered racial identities attitudes and political preferences in examining the relationship between white identity and ethnic diversity we chose to focus on an ethnic minority of particular salience in contemporary politics hispanics snip 
do whites from heavily hispanic neighborhoods show stronger white racial identity to measure identity we used a widelyused questionnaire  on a fivepoint scale participants rated their agreement with items such as being a white person is an important part of how i see myself and i feel solidarity with other white people as shown in the graph below there is a positive relationship between exposure to hispanics and white respondents sense of racial identity 
and does white identity lead to support for donald trump we examined the relationship between white identity and respondents likelihood of supporting trump for the presidency versus hillary clinton or several republican primary challengers consistent with others analyses  white identity strongly predicts a preference for trump 
whites at the high end of the racial identity scale are more than four times as likely to support trump than those at the low end of the scale perhaps thats because whites highest in racial identity are also the ones most likely to harbor negative attitudes against latinos indeed we found white identity was significantly correlated with another characteristicprejudice 
however differences in prejudice dont explain the relationship between white identity and trump support the pattern in the figure above was tested while statistically controlling for levels of antihispanic prejudice because the relationship between identity and support for trump remains strong we are confident that white identity independently predicts greater trump support 
weve seen that living close to hispanics leads whites to develop a strong sense of racial identity and that strong racial identity is associated with support for donald trump we should therefore expect that whites in heavily hispanic neighborhoods support trump more often than those in neighborhoods with fewer hispanics this prediction gains credence from work by political scientist ryan enos who finds that everyday exposure to latinos can increase support for restrictive immigration policies 
whites support for donald trump is in fact greatest in areas with a large hispanic population

Jon Bowne,2016-10-28T01:55:00.000+03:00,the great american screwjob,"schools all over america are closing on election day due to fears of violence all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything image credits flickr calibeach  
will this be the most chaotic election day in modern american history 
all across the nation schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears traditionally schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people they usually have lots of parking and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily but now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place according to fox news  voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on election day at schools in illinois maine nebraska new hampshire ohio pennsylvania wisconsin and elsewhere just a couple days ago  i shared with you a survey that found that  percent of all americans are concerned about violence happening on election day and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach november th 
many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence the following comes from fox news  
several schools across the nation have decided to close on election day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail 
the fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways endangering students 
if anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election then they arent paying much attention ed tolan the falmouth maine police chief said tuesday his community has already called off classes on nov  and an increased police presence will be felt around town 
and without a doubt voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security we have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past but we also need to realize that times have changed i believe that there is wisdom in what georgia secretary of state brian kemp told reporters  
there is a concern just like at a concert sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have  or  years ago said georgia secretary of state brian kemp cochairman of the national association of secretaries of state election committee  what if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something if that happens at a school then thats certainly concerning 
all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything 
let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that 
another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud this is something that donald trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail for instance just consider what he told a rally in pennsylvania  
we dont want to lose an election because you know what im talking about trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in manheim pa earlier this month because you know what thats a big big problem and nobody wants to talk about it nobody has the guts to talk about it so go and watch these polling places  
and of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines in illinois this week one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from republicans to democrats 
early voting in illinois got off to a rocky start monday as votes being cast for republican candidates were transformed into votes for democrats 
republican state representative candidate jim moynihan went to vote monday at the schaumburg public library 
i tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent moynihan said you could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when i tried to vote for a republican and the machine registered a vote for a democrat 
in addition if you keep up with my work on the economic collapse blog  then you already know that a number of voters down in texas have reported that their votes were switched from donald trump to hillary clinton  
well it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the clinton foundation  
according to opensecrets the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of the mccarthy group 
the mccarthy group is a major donor to the clinton foundation  apparently donating  dollars in   when it was the largest owner of united states voting machines or perhaps the  dollars went to paying bill clinton for speeches 
either way it doesnt look good 
after everything that we saw in   i am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines 
but democrats dont like poll observers because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters 
its unamerican but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that  ari berman author of the  book  give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in america  previously told the christian science monitor voting was very very dangerous i dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today i just think the loss of the official poll observers is going to be really problematic 
without a doubt this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades and i have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier 
but will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country  
if that is the outcome after all that we have been through it will be exceedingly depressing indeed newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/281016nuke.jpg,conspiracy,Fake,statistical tie latest breitbartgravis poll shows donald trump closes gap less two weeks left,watch cnn called clinton news network air fiery british conservative implosion followed something see image credits wiki commons cnn anchor hala gorani wasnt expecting network called clinton news network british firebrand conservative columnist katie hopkins daily mail watching ensuing implosion mustsee hopkins first offense daring believe donald trump going win election never good way start cnn think hes going win think guys big surprise im quite excited think weve seen similar think uk brexit saw lot liberal press kind sneering brexiteers saw lot sneering see clinton news network thats cnn youre calling us clinton news network gorani said shock youre exactly correct hopkins said two argued media obsessed polls especially ones showing hillary clinton lead hopkins destroyed gorani saying sat republican national convention cleveland watched news network entirely biased think coverage gorani refused believe said year career cnn shes seen nothing balance network oddly enough sparring match continued gorani repeatedly cut hopkins criticized clintons goes theory newsletter sign get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew related articles,1.0

a fleet of russian warships has entered the eastern mediterranean off the coast of syria amid speculations that moscow and damascus are about to launch a massive operation against terrorists in the northern syrian city of aleppo 
the commander of russian aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov told stateowned russia television network on saturday that the military vessels were positioned in the designated zone in the eastern mediterranean and are now jointly carrying out tasks maneuvering to the west of the syrian coast 
captain st rank sergei artamonov added that fighter jets have already started taking off from the carriers deck to survey the conflict zone 
flights are being carried out from the deck they are working on coordination with the shore port the flights have been going on practically every day for the last four days the highranking russian naval commander pointed out 
the remarks came a day after russias interfax news agency reported that russian mig and sukhoi warplanes routinely fly from the kuznetsov aircraft carrier into the syrian airspace to determine combat missions 
meanwhile the commander of the pyotr veliky nuclearpowered battle cruiser captain st rank vladislav malakhovsky said on saturday that no foreign aircraft dared to come closer than  kilometers away from the russian fleet this file photo shows russian frigate admiral grigorovich on its way to the mediterranean photo by reuters

Jason Easley,2016-10-29T03:41:10.067+03:00,doj complaint filed against fbi director james comey for interfering in presidential election,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  pm comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the us presidential election and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as partisan share on twitter print this post 
russia did hack the democrats so all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the us election 
but fbi director james comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the us presidential election and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as partisan 
republican fbi director james comey advised the obama administration not to publicly accuse russia of hacking the dnc and more on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the nov  election officials familiar with the deliberations told the washington post 
these sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the post on the condition of anonymity 
there are a few reasons why comey might want to keep his agencys investigation of russian interference under the radar but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be reopening its exhaustive investigation of clintons emails which resulted from a republicanled bogus overreaching and seemingly endless benghazi investigation that also cleared clinton it seems odd that comey was going to stay silent on the russia matter 
comeys decisions is especially odd given the reports that the russians have been communicating and coordinating with republican presidential nominee donald trump to the point that he is already compromised 
only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the united states president 
the same sources tell the post that comey made the decision to reveal the clinton emails to congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation 
not sure im buying that because if comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldnt have said anything at all but that doesnt mean that his motives were nefarious

Larsen Halleck,2016-10-30T20:01:09.452+02:00,why its necessary to relax into a stretch,"home this month popular why its absolutely worth it to learn game why its absolutely worth it to learn game 
jon enjoys helping others evolve into their best selves on his blog masculine development and recently launched his ebook on  strategies to develop your masculinity november   game 
after my previous article  which advocated that men learn game as a form of selfdevelopment i got a good amount of disagreementmost of it was not inaccurate the majority of rok readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game simply because western women are not as attractive as they once were 
this isnt to say that weve abandoned learning game as a whole certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship but nonetheless there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesnt believe that game is worth it anymore 
in this article i would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game in retrospect my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects i do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game in fact its quite the opposite 
as a veteran myself im quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game ive been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes ive had drinks thrown on me ive had guys threaten to slit my throat and more despite this however i still believe that it is  worth it to learn game beginners hell how dare you try to ask me my name you fucking rapist 
i believe that the reason why most men dont feel that game is worth it is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as beginners hell this is when youre just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning  and you havent developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed 
most beginners walk around not really knowing how to talk to women  how to carry themselves or how to flirt in general because of this women will typically have one of two responses they pity you and ignore you they lash out and berate you for being a creep or weird 
of course you may get the occasional girl whos drunk enough to be into you but these are few and far between for the most part the beginners hell phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous 
you will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you hell come over and steal her you will have women smack you ignore you and tell you offagain its called beginners hell for a reason s who think theyre s 
this initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our cultures general lack of femininity it is extremely obvious to anyone with eyes to see that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on the once praised virtues of nurturing empathy and kindness have now been replaced by resting bitch face sociopathy and social climbing 
this coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters means that theyve been conditioned to believe theyre highly sought after goddesses who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions and in fact theyre sometimes praised for doing so 
this is perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game couple this with severe approach anxiety a complete lack of masculinity and a weak body that hasnt been trained and its very easy to see why most men dont see that game is worth it the turning point 
once one gets beyond this initial bump however most of game is smooth sailing once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity how to balance assertiveness with consent  and has improved his game in general he enters what i call the turning point 
the turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle but its actually enjoyable this is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success such as drawing state from within rather than from without being in a state of abundance rather than scarcity improving other areas of your life which creates an upwards spiral 
if youre a newbie struggling to learn game and you dont feel like its worth it i fully empathize with your painthe problem is that when you dont have much game of course learning game will be hard because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls 
when you start to develop the three characteristics that i mentioned however a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level this allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want rather than being at the mercy of the ugly  who might want to come over and hang out internal vs external drawing of state by my age you realize that bitches aint shit but hoes and tricks 
the transition from drawing state from outside of you to drawing state from within you is literally the difference between a guy that doesnt pull at all and a guy that can pull victorias secret models 
let me explain women typically draw state from without this means that their emotions are governed by their environment this is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men why they just want to dance when a song they like comes on and its why theyre generally so emotionally volatile 
due to their changing environments their emotions change rapidly as well this is why they want men to draw state from within or in other words not be affected by their outside environments this is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions its indicative of a man who draws state from without 
as a man drawing state from within has numerous benefits the most obvious of which being that youre perpetually in a good mood once you learn to make this shift and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances women will pick up on it like a hawktheyre very attuned to this type of thing and youll definitely notice a difference in their behavior 
this will get them vying for your attention which will start to give you tremendous power this will make game fun which will lead to even more women in your life which will begin the start of your upward spiral the beginning of the upward spiral 
once you begin to make this simple mindset shift game will no longer feel like its not worth it you see game feels like its not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl with a horrible personality but when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort for a very gorgeous woman thats when game starts to be fun 
this basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like and to simply be happy by yourself will create a chain reaction within your life first youll start to get much more women much more easily this will allow you to start a harem which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship 
this state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold women will sense that youve got a ton of other women vying for your attention and they will do the sameits like a magnet that just draws them in plus if a girl does or says something that you dislike you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women 
then when you start to have so many women in your life youll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits  because you simply cant handle sleeping with all of them theyll invite you to parties and try to hook you up with their friends and youll receive many of the social benefits that they do game is worth it it just sucks at first getting over beginners hell is a lot like this once you get to the other side its all downhill though 
as i have made clear learning game at first is a huge struggleyou will encounter massive cock blocks a lot of negativity from women and not to mention youll have to deal with all of the white knights too but if you can learn to get over this initial beginners hell as ive coined it you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from 
i realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first and can feel like it isnt worth it but if you make a decision to put in the effort and learn it your world will literally be x better than before if youre struggling with learning game initially be sure to maximize your appearance 
get some height increasing soles read through some of the style articles on rok get a good designer haircut and learn to perfect your appearance at least as much as you can consider taking some martial arts classes to boost your confidence as well 
ultimately however if you want to learn game and experience what its like to have dozens of hot girls hitting you up you just have to bite the bullet and go out go clubbing go to bars go on trips to las vegas or miami approach women during the day and approach them during the nighteventually youll get over this beginners hell and will experience an abundance of women in your life",english,returnofkings.com,No Image URL,hate,Real,airbnb goes full sjw demands users host deviants every kind home,repeatedly shown articles fan aspects fitnessnot strength developing muscular mass also cardiovascular endurance flexibility well likely knew already also likely aware done several articles stretching recently relax stretch technique state used predominantly lower body stretching splits likely always considered benchmark hip leg flexibility upper body flexibility people dont focus important train lower body flexibility namely purposes increased athletic performance reduction joint aches pains cases increased strength taught readers basic upper body stretches past chest stretch door frame stretch opinion youre going one stretch upper body flexibility would seated twist stretch works stretch involves crossing legs manner discussed twisting torso simultaneously locking arm onto bent knees stretch hit prominent upper body musclesthe latissimus dorsi triceps deltoids obliques neck pectorals addition visible muscles twist stretch work deep spinal muscles even muscles buttocks gluteus maximus medius minimus well many athletes perform twist stretch particularly combat athletes wrestlers judokas mixed martial artists need great torso flexibility escape holds pinfalls sounds like something ought learn doesnt happily admitted past likely paul wades outstanding convict conditioning series taught many exercises cannot advocate wades writing enough specifically twist stretch comes convict conditioning first book deals core calisthenic seriespushups squats like already gone detail contrast second book deals static holds develop strength flexibility lsit todays topic third book deals explosive movements back front handsprings topic another time instead lets go steps twist stretch pictures taken directly book exercises first twist stretch easy twist stretch sit floor feet extended take one foot put inside leg resting foot next opposite knee shown twist body opposite shoulder turns towards raised kneed ie left knee raised turn right shoulder vice versa keep foot flat ground knee stationaryjust twist torso allow neck turn naturally wants turn lock torso placing elbow opposite side knee holding body hand immediately begin feel stretch around torso hold stretch seconds side comfortable move step simple twist stretch requires little bit flexibility place one foot leg shown take foot flat ground bend leg back touch heel foot opposing buttock ie right heel touches left buttock foot position used twist stretches henceforth rotate torso towards opposite knee right shoulder left knee vice versa locking placing elbow opposite side knee supporting body hand hold seconds move stretch things become difficult assume position stretch time rotate torso much force goal stretch extend arm touch instep foot flat floor arm wont able stretch dont advise try accomplish proper torso rotation stretch difficulty increase get hand towel object foot long assume stretching position rotate torso holding said towel remove supporting hand floor flick towel hole made raised leg obviously hand extending instep wrapping support hand around back grab end towel begins stretch time stretch assume position holding towel two hands work hands towel slowly bringing hands together gripping greater portions towel eventually able clasp fingers final level twist stretch process slow arduouscoach wade admits took better part year accomplish moving fingers together inch inch quite final level yeta rough measurement shows inches towel go fingers touch certainly noticed increased mobility flexibility already towel stretch made easier remembering worm hands towel one actively use secure deeper stretches notice progress even easiest variations stretch make notice immediate healing spine back deliciously crack youll feel warm limber afterwards practicing advanced variants make limber whatever physical activity engage ranging dancing getting submission holds could one millions americans bad backs hips choice read necessary relax stretch,0.0

Letsbereal,2016-10-26T11:26:00.000+03:00,eu states agree caps on wholesale roaming charges,"as the election is inching slowly towards its end experts are nervously scrambling to find any dirt that would stop the trump train
first megyn kelly pulled the sexist card then it was his undisclosed tax returns then his comments on john mccain then making fun of crippled reporters then his reading of mein kampf then his remarks about dating his daughter
then accusations of racism from former employees his usage of eminent domain hiring of immigrants and other questionable practices the trump university scandal his blunder on abortion old comments on drug decriminalization and gun control his relationship with the clintons and the dc insiders his comments on refugees and illegal immigrants the khan incident and of course the pussygrabbing scandal

surely this time it will sink his campaign wont it  and yet each time teflon don deflects dirt more dexterously than ghetto trash trying escape alimony payments nothing seems to be able to stop him not that his opponents will ever stop trying
trump has the fantastic ability to escape unharmed from what would clearly destroy any career politician howard deans yeehaw was enough to end his bid for the democratic candidate in  and yet trump can call for an end to muslim refugees be accused of grabbing women by their loins and end up being praised for it by the masses while the mainstream media spew their bile 

what has allowed trump to maneuver so nimbly against these accusations is the unprecedented role of internet media in elections including being able to reach people directly through twitter and a lack of trust in traditional media as well as his biggerthanlife persona letting him get away with what others would be lynched for
but thats the story for another article i would rather talk about something else particularly is there anything that could stop him the answer will surprise you as it goes against all conventional wisdom
yes but its not what you think
trumps weak spot 
one of the biggest problems with defeating trump is that unlike other politicians political scandals not only seem to not affect him but they even aid him there is a saying that every antitrump meme is also a protrump meme

trump has mastered political antifragility which causes him to only strengthen when opponents try to destroy him trump has defeated the lefts no platform for fascists mentality by saying things so outrageous they have no option but to report on him
so the left cannot choose to not cover him and let him wallow in obscurity like they did with ron paul neither can they attack him for each of their attacks only make him more popular

one memorable movie quote i remember went something like this every man has a weak spot first you try to buy him with money then women then you go for his family and if that doesnt work well a bullet always does the job unfortunately unlike other political losers don does not need other peoples money nor does he lack female attention and his family is smart and probably safe from violence
but this isnt an article about god forbid donald trump getting assassinated that would stop trump but not the trump train trump is more than a man trump is an idea he is the avatar of discontent of all those opposed to progressive ideology he would become a martyr thus raising the hatred for his opponents to a fever pitch which might alter americas consciousness forever trumps enemies cant afford that
so if ignoring trump does not work throwing dirt at him does not work bribing him doesnt work and even killing him wont work than what is left the answer might surprise you
you see trumps power comes from his contrarianism he is not a candidate he is an anticandidate people dont just vote for trump they vote against hillary obama progressives and cuckservatives he is the wrecking ball who the injured working class and all nonliberal whites as well as minorities not completely in love in with progressive marxist ideology want to use against the establishment
so what can be done to stop him  
well lets ask ourselves what makes trump popular  his brashness his antipc attitudes his antielitism his not being a part of the establishment hacks his being not one of them his being different
so if that is what gives trump strength it would make sense that to weaken him you would have to present him as the opposite of that to present him as being nothing special to make him look boring and weak to present him as just another pcdrone
theyve claimed nonstop that trump is the next hitler and that he will start building concentration camps and sexually assaulting random women by grabbing their cock pockets and will obliterate muslims and minorities with right wing death squad robots

instead they could have claimed that he is just weakling trying to act tough and that he wont deliver anything that he is in love with political correctness and respects women that he is a progressives best choice that he will bring four more years of obama
that of course would present its own difficulties in the age of online media the monopoly of physical press has been broken when news circulates at the speed of minutes rather than hours and days it would be very hard for the establishment media to accomplish this it is very hard to call trump ordinary and boring when his statements break so many taboos
yet as difficult as it may have been at the very least it would have had a chance of success as small as it was calling him sexist racist and other mean words did nothing to stop him and instead only made him more popular with the masses some of these incidents have made donald seem human and it made people trust him more showing his flaws had the opposite effect as intended as those who hated him already needed no extra ammo but those who liked him were either left indifferent or whats worse excited by his statements

at worst a few moderates had doubts set in their mind however considering what short attention span undecided voters have his stellar performance at the second debate clearly made them forget about the statement and maybe even convinced them to focus on bills sexual misdeeds instead
why havent his opponents used this against him 
this brings us to the final point of this article why havent his opponents used this against him have they not the brains to figure this out hard to believe considering the amount of money being poured into think tanks
no the truth is like that the strategy was forsaken because of the sideeffects it would have on their own camp should his opponents try to attack him as another pc drone they would be also attacking themselves just like hillary trying to paint trump as sex offender only made it easier for trump to point at bills sexual indiscretions as it has been said in the mighty book of kek  thee that dwell in glass lodgings shall not propel sedimentary formations the prophecy of kek chapter   verse  

attacking trump for being multicultural politically correct weak inefficient or a shill would only shed light on the establishments own weakness
this means that in order to draw voters away from trump they would have to claim trump loves multiculturalism antiracism open borders free trade globalism and offer another candidate who would be even more extreme than him on these crucial issues

using this strategy against trump even if it was successful would be a pyrrhic victory for his opponents as cuckservatives would have to acknowledge they cant woo supporters with talks about reducing taxes and bringing back reaganism the truth is the future is bleak for reaganbushcuck wing of the gop even if they were to win the election they would lose the war

the left has won the cultural war not just by winning elections but by cultural metawarfare instead of moderating their message in attempt to win election they used popular culture and mass media to push liberal values to the masses and so the right wing had no option but do concessions dropping people who opposed civil rights womens liberation and closed borders
to put it simply the battle was lost even before trump cametrump was the match that ignited the powder keg he simply mobilized people and said what others kept in private but always wanted to say and now there is no turning back
the elites cannot choose to ignore popular will and still win elections anymore they will have to reform the gop to account for their constituencys desire or risk ending in the dust bin of history there is no longer the option to charm the sheeple with talks about low taxes open borders and the awfulness of bigotry they will have to at least nominally give something back to the people to stay in power
as one wise commenter on this site once said  trump may be a liar like the rest of them but at least he is saying the right lies
the next thing people on the manosphere and the altright will have to look after will be trumplike figures who will copy trumps rhetoric but will fail to deliver any solutions or they will try to coopt and redirect that anger but for now for the first time in more than  years we are winning the culture war

the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint against representative jason chaffetz on monday morning with the office of congressional ethics for his role in releasing information provided to him by fbi director james comey

mohsen abdelmoumen  according to you when we see the numerous demonstrations antitrump in the united states after the election of donald trump at the presidency are we witnessing a colored revolution
wayne madsen it is classic sorosfunded color revolution soros is financing moveonorg black lives matter demos and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators
in your very relevant books devoted to george soros soros quantum of chaos you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world from where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable
soros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person evelyn de rothschild along with his family they are all the true puppet masters of the world
soros remains a major element in the antitrump device can trump resist him
more disrespecting the american imperial presidency trump won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the sorosrothschild puppet masters and certainly not to trump
can we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions
secret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the sanhedrin and pharisees in palestine and the dionysian cults of the nile valley and the mediterranean region
in your book  isis is us  the shocking truth behind the army of terror you detail the relations between the usa and isisdaesh what is the triggering element that has put you on this trail
trumps national security adviser retired lt gen michael flynn revealed that the us was supporting isis and then he was forced to resign my own sources in the middle east confirmed this long before flynn made his public statement and was fired as defense intelligence agency chief by obama
you mention western sahara and the involvement of the clintons in a deal with the kingdom of morocco while this case is under the authority of un arent the clintons outlaws such bonnie and clyde by supporting morocco against the sahrawi people and the uns resolutions
the clintons received at least  million from the moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to moroccos agenda which includes permanently annexing western sahara as the southern province morocco and israel share the same policy on annexing illegallyoccupied territories
according to your diverse very interesting analysis can we assert that the world government or the false prophets of the new world order are the real decisionmakers of this world
i mentioned a few already sorosrothschild others are the bilderbergs bohemian club and the council on foreign relations and their counterparts
you know very well some american intelligence agencies like the nsa do these intelligence agencies serve the us interests or rather the oligarchys interests
the cia has always served the interests of wall street nsa now serves the interests of the global security network it leads
you were an officer in the us navy was the whistleblower you are today born after your military career or before
before i was an fbinavy whistleblower in  and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the us navy that reached into the reaganbush white house and was ultimately exposed in the washington times in  my whistleblowing cost me my navy career however and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs
in the recent us election we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls didnt one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes dont we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the new world order and its purely capitalist product globalization
 percent of major newspapers endorsed clinton many alternative news sources supported trump we are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate tv and websites to the alternative media of which waynemadsenreportcom has been prominent since its founding in 
snowden has denounced the prism program and you have denounced echelon both of which serve the interests of the worlds oligarchic caste what is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg
what is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between nsa and private companies like microsoft apple google facebook and major telecommunications companies it is much greater than even snowdens documents describe
the quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings how all these truths have been hidden
the major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events
i advise everyone to read the wayne madsen report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media how do you explain that we who are resisting to what i call the fascist oligarchic caste are called conspiracy theorists is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed
the term conspiracy theorist was developed by the cia in the mids to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of president kennedy it has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into irancontra  and other deep state crimes
your book  the star and the sword  is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the zionist entity of israel and saudi arabia you claim that they organize false flag attacks including the  what is the origin and nature of this israelisaudi strategic alliance do you think that the jasta law will succeed or will it be countered by the zionist allies of saudi arabia do the fact that the usa and the westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the saudis to yemen isnt due to the weight of the lobby zionist
the zionistwahhabisaudi alliance goes back to ibn saud who wrote the british and zionist leaders that he did not oppose a jewish homeland in palestine so long as it did not lay claim to saudi territory on the eastern shore of the gulf of aqaba the relationship has always been close except for the time of king faisal who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative
do you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do if so how do you live it
i was forced to move my domicile from washington because the outgoing obama administration put pressure on some media organizations i did work for these included rt contributor agreement canceled and al jazeera america which is now defunct
the fbi entered my apartment in washington at least twice and ive had three visits by them at my new home in florida
i was informed of  personal threats in washington
i ignore all these pressures and continue to exercise the freedom of the press
are you optimistic or do you think that the satanist project of the oligarchy still has a nuisance capacity that can plunge the world into chaos
as with cockroaches which detest light the shadow figures of covert power cannot stand what is known as the disinfectant of sunshine light has always fought against darkness and will continue to do so

Craig Murphy,2016-10-26T22:46:46.529+03:00,no title,"will it be representative government or thugocracy exclusive erik rush envisions clinton using high court as a bludgeon against liberty published  mins ago erik rush about   archive erik rush is a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare his latest book is negrophilia from slave block to pedestal  americas racial obsession in  he was the first to give national attention to the story of sen barack obamas ties to militant chicago preacher rev jeremiah wright initiating a media feeding frenzy erik has appeared on fox news hannity and colmes cnn and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances print 
 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant 
in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates 
the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government

André du Pôle,2016-11-05T20:40:33.135+02:00,american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female indiana jones brand,"why you should become a minimalist why you should become a minimalist february    comments lifestyle 
the most abused word in the english language is need if youre reading this post i contend there is little that you actually need beyond what you currently possess you have ample electricity to power your computer in a climatecontrolled environment with running water and food in your wellstocked refrigerator why then do you always hear people talking about how they need more stuff 
humans have a deeplyrooted drive to compete with each other and advertisers capitalize on this impulse take a moment to picture the average person that you meet what do they have to take pride in buying the newest thing allows them to join the club of consumers and for a fleeting moment to be measured on an equal playing field despite their personal shortcomings the internal pain of their lifes problems dissipates for the split second they can boast superiority over everyone who doesnt have the same shiny widget 
this conspicuous consumption creates a selffulfilling egoinvestment in the broken system although borrowing money for useless luxury purchases subjugates people into debt slavery the mentality is if i paid  for this hunk of metal and im working overtime to pay it off it must be worth it  and so are other things that the commercials are telling me to buy quite literally we are working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we dont need  
if youre reading this blog you are likely a male aged  who wants to do one or more of the following quit your job travel explore a locationindependent income get yourself in shape take charge of a relationship and learn valuable life skills a minimalist mentality helps you do all of these things 
having fewer possessions forces you to properly place a higher value on experiences this will make it safer and more fulfilling to travel because you are in touch with what truly makes you happy if youre working on a side hustle or starting a business the desire for needless possessions drains your disposable income levels and prevents you from taking risks if my business fails will i have to give up my car lease preempt this loss aversion by having less to lose 
if you want to move to a better city with a higher cost of living having excess stuff sets a floor on how much rent youll pay to house your crap and in turn how much you can spend on leisure activities if youre a distractable person like me removing visual noise from your area makes you more likely to create things with your mind and less likely to fixate on your environment  
throwing or giving useless things away is a good first step since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them to fully embrace this mindset you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth cut down on your consumer impressions by watching less tv and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter find fulfillment in hobbies and work rather than chasing the rush and eventual hedonic adaptation from consuming much like a drug successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no different but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down 
girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living space she beings to tell you that you need a new this or a replacement that a good friend once told me all human beings have an innate desire to create  most women cant so they redecorate limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism ironically men likely to lead a minimalistnomadic lifestyle are simply more attractive to primesmv women think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass as always watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change 
ask yourself this if your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your back what would you be worth to society and to yourself how would you feel about losing all of the possessions you own most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing aunt gladyss vase or baby pictures they havent looked at in a decade this is an illusion once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to stuff you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences 
minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness i dont wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day  i simply choose to allocate my money to experiences and a few possessions that will fulfill me and advance my lifes purpose rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere 
taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you i dont promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody happy but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of self and will allow you to focus on the internal and external traits that exemplify a man of value",english,returnofkings.com,No

dr duke and pastor dankof on trumps america first foreign policy 
today dr duke had pastor mark dankof as his guest for the hour they talked about donald trumps appointments to his new cabinet they gave low marks to representative mike pompeo as the new cia director for his past policy positions although they noted his loyalty to trump as a potential silver lining they also panned nikki hailey as the un ambassador which however does allow trump supporter henry mcmaster succeed her as south carolina governor 
the most hopeful prospect is congresswoman tulsi gabbard from hawaii who is a potential secretary of state she has supported trumps desire to reconcile with russia and has been the most vocal opponent in congress of the obama administrations efforts to overthrow syrian president assad her appointment would go a long way towards wresting control of american foreign policy from jewish neocons and putting americas interests first again

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-02T06:45:41.336+02:00,obamas secret muslim list,"search form search from bad to worse  obamas ransom payment to iran is just the tip of the iceberg in his bid to pursue a legacy obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon november   ari lieberman 
most of us including several democratic lawmakers cringed when obama inked the iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the iranian regime recoiled in horror when we learned that obama transferred  million to the iranians in exchange for four american citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges the  million was part of a larger installment totaling  billion ostensibly to settle claims iran had against the united states stemming from aborted iranian arms purchases dating back to the shah obama claimed that this was money that was owed to iran and the settlement which included  billion in interest saved the us taxpayer billions because the iranians were demanding even more at the hague tribunal where the claim was being adjudicated 
the timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geopolitical concerns the americans were freed only after iran received its  million the payment which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane was made in untraceable cash stacked on wooden pallets the iranians demanded swiss francs and euros rather than dollars and a pliant obama agreed to the islamic republics dictates gleeful iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom contradicting the administrations adamant denials 
even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom state department spokesman mark toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the  million was used as leverage to ensure the americans safe return the white house however quickly repudiated the state departments characterization 
even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the us to extortion and hostagetaking the iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not every twobit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well 
but there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story in his january   address to the american people obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the islamic republic but as noted by rick richman in an excellent article featured in mosaic  the deal struck with the iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the american people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement 
the  million that the us transferred to iran came from irans foreign military sales fms account with the pentagon the balance of  billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since  but obama neglected to note that when iran filed its lawsuit the us filed counterclaim against iran for  million for iranian breaches of its obligations under the fms program the us could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the american treasury courtesy of the islamic republic 
moreover american plaintiffs maintained sixteen us court judgments against the islamic republic stemming from that regimes involvement in terrorist activities those judgments totaled  billion in compensatory and punitive damages 
some plaintiffs sought to recover their judgments directly from irans fms account but their efforts were stymied by the clinton administration instead under a convoluted deal struck between congress and the clinton administration in  the us treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and  percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the fms fund the judgments would then be subrogated to the united states which meant that judgments became direct us claims against the iranian government 
iran ignored the judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs under us law the  million sitting in the fms account should have gone back to the us treasury which had already paid the judgment holders but the us treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to iran essentially the us taxpayer ended up footing the bill for irans terrorism while the iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence 
obamas actions represented blatant disregard for the law for the victims of terrorism and for the american taxpayer his claim of saving the taxpayer billions represents the zenith of mendacity 
obama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures but as noted by richman the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle iranian claims instituted at the hague exposing yet another lie by the obama administration 
there was one and only one reason why the iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is the iranians are the worlds foremost statesponsors of international terrorism they finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing hence they demanded untraceable cash the misery that we are currently witnessing in syria yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the obama administration which provided the iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing 
in addition to the  billion in cash obama also authorized the release of seven convicted iranian felons and expunged warrants on  others but this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal 
lastly the transfer of such a large sum to iran in settlement of an alleged legal claim required the attorney generals approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing loretta lynchs signature authorizing such payment on october  sen marco rubio r fla and rep mike pompeo r kan presented lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal lynch whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers queries 
in a desperate attempt to establish a legacy obama pursued the iran deal with reckless abandon forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in us diplomatic history the ancillary deal struck with the iranians concerning american hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the iranians to continue their reign or regional terror more importantly it may also have been in violation of existing us law and lynchs stonewalling only lends credence to that

the cbs news republicans hoped that fbi director james comeys letter about new clinton related emails would swing the election for them but a new series of cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping her lead and within  points of trump in arizona 
battleground tracker found that by a small margin comeys letter made democrats more likely net  to support clinton 
in the individual battleground states clinton leads by eight points in pennsylvania  north carolina  and in colorado  the only state of the four polled where trump has a small two point lead in arizona  
according to cbs news  and the larger demographic difference defining the race between clinton and donald trump has been a gender gap  slightly larger now than the last time in these states  that offsets a smaller movement of republicans to trump 
to put it another way hillary clintons support with women is going up at a larger rate than republican movement towards trump 
these are the first swing state polls to be taken since fbi director comey released his now infamous letter on friday the email story isnt moving voters it is reinforcing the partisanship of the election democrats are going to vote clinton republicans are going to vote for trump and there arent enough undecided voters to swing the election to trump 
republicans were hoping for a hail mary touchdown to save trump but clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day if the comey letter is the big october surprise it isnt working on voters

video 
chuck todd asked mook if he believed the email story could cost clinton the election 
he answered 
i dont think so look as i said we have over  volunteers out there were seeing record early voting numbers in north carolina florida look i would wager in nevada turnout is so strong among democrats there hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in nevada were feeling really good about this record turnout over  million people in our country now registered to vote fifty million of those are young people were just nose to the grindstone and were going to finish this out but people should not take anything for granted and were going to have to work hard to earn this 
hillary clinton could put nevada out of reach for trump this week but whether or not that happens is up to the voters if democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states the email story wont matter if democrats dont show up that is trumps only chance of winning 
the early voting numbers that hillary clinton is running up in florida north carolina and nevada are no accident clinton and the democratic party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states 
democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the  election but donal trumps refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area 
the final week before the election could be just as vital to democrats in swing states as election day if hillary clinton piles up big margins in early voting it could leave minimal drama for election night

Gillian,2016-11-07T15:14:04.731+02:00,get ready for a likely market crash after election video w transcript,"by gordon duff senior editor on october   radio host and trump supporter claims jewish mafia controls us 
editors note the insanity has hit trump mouthpiece and arch zionist alex jones is on the warpath against the jewish mob israels newspapers are shocked as you can see below  or are they trump grandson of a brothel owner son of a slum lord grew up in meyer lanskys mobrun new york and by his s became the ingenuemoney boy of jewish mob kingpin roy cohn it was roy cohn and the jewish mob that built trumps empire and ran interference for him with the gambinos john gotti  company now covering this up seems to be really important but to whom and why 
the article below was published in todays jerusalem post not a word of it is true moreover it is an obvious deflection piece written to save trumps nazi supporters backing in face of vts slam dunk assertions of trumps zionist fanaticism 
after all trump has pushed for war on iran for clearing out the west bank and for a one state solution in israel with palestinians going through the chimneys 
but why then are americas jew haters the human filth that would gas americas jews the big trump lovers some of it comes from the nazi movement itself largely begun as a fundraiser by the adljdlaipacsplc lobby you see no swastikas painted on synagogues no big corporate donations on alex jones by brother nathaniel  a long accused rabid antizionist 
the controversy of alex bullhorn jones being an alleged zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent zionistjewish connections on his  personal staff  website advertisers  link to time warner president edgar bronfman jr 
jones seeming allegiance to zionism which explains why he virtually never targets zionist jews or the racist zionist rogue state of israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks  may well stem from a protestantzionist belief system and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a jew  which makes his two children jewish under talmudic law and eligible for the israeli law of return  
with additional information on jones which this site is now providing alex jones zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global zionism becomes ever more obvious 
trump has played the hate card from day one building his base on hatred of blacksafrican americans messicans and of course he has played the terror card the yellow hordes card and the elite liberal card as well 
that one is aimed at the jews trump whose empire was built by roy cohn and who has been supported and financed by jewish organized crime and now by vegas boss shelly adelson who can buy and sell trump out of his trump change has always been a front for the jewish mob jewish mobsters as oft pointed out by ian greenhalgh have surrounded trump and embarrassed him if you can imagine that more than once 
years ago during nasty litigation radio host jeff rense former partner of alex jones tracked jones and his backing to the jewish mob and the bronfman crime family accused of their complicity in financing  
now we see the zionist press pulling out the antisemite card on alex jones one of israels strongest supporters in the us is this a joke of course this kind of childishness would only work with the brain dead jew hating nazis that have flocked to trump with trumps effusive love of everything israel and everything zionist one might ask why the nazis flock to him but nazis have never been thinkers and are great followers even when they are sent over a cliff like lemmings 
comment boards at vt have been inundated with paid trolls some who track back to israel others employed by trump surrogate operations tied to his campaign toads and trolls get up to  for a comment placed even on wrong articles thus we have closed comments to cut off this income source and clean out the trash were we can even though this is the best money trump pays out except for hookers 
when are american jews going to rise off their knees and hit back at well at israel the adl and the rising tide of naziism in the us paid for by their donations

an african man has been shot and killed after he reportedly attacked and injured a police officer outside the us embassy in kenyas capital nairobi 
the man was shot dead after a confrontation with officers guarding the embassy a police source said thursday on condition of anonymity without specifying the cause of the confrontation 
national police spokesman george kinoti said the man was killed by the police officer in selfdefense 
it was a lone criminal who attacked a police officer kinoti said adding he was armed with a knife 
fiona evans a us embassy spokeswoman confirmed there had been a shooting incident outside the mission adding that no embassy personnel were involved without giving further details 
the us embassy in nairobi is located in a heavilyfortified compound opposite the main un complex in gigiri an upmarket suburb in the citys north 
the police officer involved in the incident was a member of the paramilitary general services unit deployed to guard the embassy

friday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags breast cancer  mammography  harming women naturalnews every year millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a womans breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors but surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice  which studies show isnt even an effective screening tool and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive itthe public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure found that mammography is neither effective nor safe after looking at data on more than  women between the ages of  and  who underwent the procedure on a routine basis researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy  resulting in their rapid demiseas published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews  the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good  because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer thus the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments and not at the forefront of womens medicineif we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by  and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at  it means that for every  women invited for screening throughout  years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and  healthy women  who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily the authors concluded group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good one year after this review was published a second one published in the new england journal of medicine nejm came to a similar conclusion a team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist a clinical epidemiologist a pharmacologist an oncologic surgeon a nurse scientist a lawyer and a health economist decided that the medical industrys claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunkthey found that for every  women screened in the us over a year annual screening period beginning at age  one breast cancer death would be prevented while a shocking  to  women would have a false positive while  to  would undergo an unnecessary biopsy between three and  of these women the study found would also be overdiagnosed for a nonmalignant form of cancer that never even would have become clinically apparentthis study out of switzerland corroborates another out of canada  the  canadian national breast screening study  which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination in other words the procedure is completely unnecessary and in many cases exceptionally harmful and on and on the list goes with data out of norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isnt all that its cracked up to be us data spanning the course of nearly  years shows that more women are over or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully earlydiagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization this represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesnt worki

Bob Menefee,2016-10-26T22:46:37.613+03:00,no title,"state that fired pastor demands his sermons notes this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority published  mins ago about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print dr eric walsh photo first liberty 
the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church 
but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons 
walshs ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church 
lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired 
at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today 
now in response to walshs lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen 
the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest  
in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded  different categories of materials including sermons from  us 
welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons 
first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon notes all documents without even topical or time limits it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor every church every denomination and every citizen of faith in america 
leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee part of the nations largest public policy womens group with  members also came to walshs defense 
penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr eric walsh is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs 
can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share 
wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him 
no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist 
state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing 
the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up 
pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make it warm  ive thought that through its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway 
then there was laughter from both parties 
oneal then said to inform walsh youre out and there was another round of laughter 
its very funny pfirman said

sooner rather than later all internet roads will lead to the same new world order socialist philosophy
as profiling of internet users becomes more prolific and the algorithms more sophisticated in the coming years the news and information we search for will be tailored to slowly nudge us one way or the other politically one small step at a time
the management of the information we get to read is already in its infancy
why do you think that free app on your phone that only performs a few functions swells in size with each update that is released do you really think they give a damn about your privacy and are plugging security holes hell no the apps we download are moving from useful lowresource using services to resource hogs necessitating an upgrade in processing power every year or two because they only provide us with a free service in order to hook us so the apps can gather information about everything weve ever written on our devices for social engineers and marketing flacks the apps are becoming more sophisticated in the way they monitor everything we do  which is why the apps need all that memory size
and soon apps will be gathering information about everything weve ever said aloud by using the built in microphones on each device and speech recognition technology cia agents confirm microphones can easily be activated even when a device is switched completely off
this type of information will be collected in giant databases such as the utah data center with the ultimate goal being the corporategovernment complex knowing more about us than we know about ourselves
big brother was so yesterday orwells big brother idea never could have imagined the insidious nature of todays information technology
todays information technology has put big brother on steroids
the waking times details this frightful world that is already emerging as anyone who pays attention knows search engines are already tailoring information to what we search for and even what we text people about
mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth
most of the time the information one will see in this internet bubble will be customized to suit a persons interests this is why facebook relentlessly pushes the like a page or product portion of its web site this information is used to build a profile of a person that ultimately will be able to accurately predict the color of their next bowel movement
if a man is interested in nongmo foods advertising and news stories will be tailored to inform him of grocers who sell organics and about news from approved outlets with stories written on the topic most of the time this will be insidious advertising and ads disguised as information
hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands
the utah data center is designed to store exabytes of information on all forms of communication including emails cell phone calls and internet searches as well as all types of personal data trailsparking receipts travel itineraries and bookstore purchases
as another example okay we know you are interested in traditional gender roles we  the information managers like facebook and google will now to find news stories and customize the information you get to read online in order to cause you to doubt the validity of your beliefs the ultimate goal is to slowly but steadily move you away from believing in traditional gender roles to believing in militant feminism without you realizing what we have done
this type of information management is even more insidious than outright censorship as it will be designed to steer everyone towards what the controllers of society want us to think and buy no matter how far from the ideal consumer and fellow traveler we may be
think of it as a game of plinko on the price is right in which all chips ultimately fall into the perfect braindead consumer slot at the bottom of the maze the social engineers dream is a world of nothing but sexless consumers who perform mindless work in meaningless jobs whose only outlets for pleasure are shopping and eating out and other stateapproved activities
think thats hyperbole travel around the world for six months to a year then come back to the united states and tell me what you think
little information bubbles merge into big information bubbles we become what we are repeatedly exposed to which is why a war is on for your mind
once we have you believing a certain way or questioning your established beliefs the key comes when it is time to steer public perception one way or the other this is where the rubber meets the road in the realm of managing the populace like so many sheeple
but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone
soon just like the mainstream media on television and in print everything you see online will be directed at making you think behave and vote a certain way the micromanagement and control of information just hasnt become that sophisticated  yet
obama already hinted that only official information should be linked up by the corporate interests of facebook google etc look for hillary to implement that idea with an iron fist if she is whisked into the oval office  an internet security crisis will likely be engineered in the near future in whichyou guessed itbig daddy government needs to step in and take control of the web from there on out we will be back to corporategovernment propaganda instead of the libertarians dream the current iteration of the internet is
so the awakening we have seen from the brainwashing of the corporate media will be a temporary one if the elite have anything to do with it the groundwork of this new socialist system of micromanaging information is already being laid you already see it every time you do a search
someday soon the only information well be able to find online will be from sources the corporategovernment complex approves of of course there will be renegades and rebels like us who resist but most of the braindead sheeple out there will go along to get along just as has been happening since time immemorial
our options will be to get off the grid or to move to a new internet neither move will be peacefully tolerated by the powers that be

No Author,2016-11-09T06:39:24.595+02:00,guinessbook   millions daméricains battent ensemble le record dapnée  le gorafi,"keywords body detox  breath  breathing exercises  breathing techniques 
breathing  a process that goes almost unnoticed and happens on such a deep subconscious level yet it is vital for our being nowadays there are more and more cases of people breathing incorrectly 
living in a big city surrounded by constant stress pollution and technology can sometimes bring the body out of sync with the natures flow young children know how to breathe correctly on an intuitive level their body follows the rhythm of nature 
with time as the stress increases and obstacles come into our lives we quickly forget our calm manner of breathing and switch to a frantic one instead without even realizing it cancer prevention 
in  dr otto warburg received a nobel prize when he proved that cancer cells are anaerobic  this means that they cannot survive in high levels of oxygen when a body is low on oxygen some cells start to replace it by fermenting sugar a normal cell gets its energy through a process of respiration of oxygen whereas a cancer cell does it through fermentation cardiovascular health 
hypertension is all too common quite often as a result of stress in order to lower the blood pressure its important to decrease the stress levels  one of the oldest and most natural ways to do that is through deep slow breathing not only does it calm your heart beat but it allows the blood to flow at a more even pace 
research was conducted over a  year period that showed how proper breathing can prolong the lifespan  as well as increase general health the framingham study found a correlation between the vital capacity meaning the largest amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs after a deep breath and the lifespan of that person an increased vital capacity means a potentially longer lifespan cure for depression 
brain needs oxygen to work just like any other organ in the body stroke has a tendency to leave the body paralyzed as a result one of the causes is the lack of oxygen supply to the brain during a stroke this is an extreme example but looking on a smaller scale there is a connection between improper breathing and depression long periods of even a slightly limited air supply to the body caused by improper breathing can lead to a decrease in cognitive functions symptoms such brain fog forgetfulness lack of concentration and in the end depression are all interconnected increased energy levels 
have you ever told someone youre tired and in return you were told to go for a walk or do a light exercise this is because the body converts oxygen into energy through a process called cellular respiration  when you inhale the air correctly more of it gets to your body thus increasing the energy levels through conversion it is also one of the reasons why people who exercise on a regular basis are generally more energetic than those with sedentary lifestyles different breathing techniques 
there is a countless number of breathing techniques for different purposes and each one of them has its own benefits breathing exercises can lower or raise blood pressure improve sleep help with anxiety and much more 
yoga is one of the practices that incorporates breathing exercises called pranayama as an essential part of the process coming from the east its uncertain when exactly yoga originated but there is evidence that it has been around for at least  years  yogic breathing techniques have been applied for thousands of years making them timeproof i will share with you a couple of my favorite breathing techniques that i personally use in different situations best body detoxifier

Bob Unruh,2016-10-26T23:07:28.355+03:00,see dems accept foreign cash to disrupt trump rallies,"print saeed toosi right and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping  of his students and charged with advocating corruption 
saeed toosi  winner of the first prize for reading the quran both internationally and locally fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi reported al arabiya 
in an audio recording toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and together with the head of irans judicial authority had agreed to a coverup to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a muchneeded dose of truth about the religion of peace 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake one of the victims  a recent firstplace winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was  while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition the mentor according to the charge booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place 
all victims who have filed statements were between  and  at the time of the alleged attacks the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than  countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei current supreme leader of iran he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan last may toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council with many of irans top officials in attendance 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership but officials dismissed their claims citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic 
according to the reformist amad news officials held a twohour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged 
judiciary chief ayatollah sadeq larijani whom the victims audio showed conspiring with khamenei to cover up the incidents defended the regimes handling of the case london guardian reported larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the voa story so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not 
the case has been given to a judge for a ruling though there will be no public trial awad news reports members of the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution are planning to assassinate toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation 
toosi who has denied the charges against him  calling them total lies meant to discredit irans religious institutions and the ayatollah  is reportedly threatening to release the names of  of irans top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children if the prosecution proceeds",english,wnd.com,http://www.wnd.com/files/2013/02/111010_ala_immigration_children_605_ap.jpg,bias,Real,feds born illegals year,judge warns dangers appointed judiciary unelected unaccountable

KD7ONE,2016-10-26T16:49:00.000+03:00,no title,"donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests luke stranahan 
luke stranahan is an engineer by trade and an armed patriot by inclination he writes for return of kings as a leisure pursuit and an attempt to do his part to help reverse the slide into moral decrepitude of modern society follow him on twitter november   politics 
next tuesday is the american election and for better or for worse well pick the next president at that time assuming we dont get mired in voter fraud and recounts and well either brace for government mandated sjw enemas or bask in a temporary setback of those evil people but today i want to talk on trump once to match an article from last week and i intend to focus on how he is the american candidate as opposed to the special interest groups one 
i had a conversation last week with some people who acted as sjws but were later presented by a mutual friend as libertarian the discussion immediately went nasty with my opposition painting trump and anyone who supported him as a racist and a bigot upon trying to determine why two of the lefts ubiquitous labels were applied to me this time i learned that their perspective was unless you were universally for all special interest groups you were a bigot or a racist false dichotomy and the american nightmare 
the problem i found out was that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into a black or white situation either you want all refugees here from the middle east all the hispanics from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their lives around or youre a racist theres simply no middle ground 
they dont understand that trump is not a special interest candidate by which i mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of us at our expense but he is not racist towards minorities or sexist towards women 
it is possible to be against illegal immigration but treat americans of hispanic ancestry as valued citizens whom you will represent it is possible to be against feminism affirmative action and the persecution of men for the profit of women yet still value american women as americans themselves it is possible to note that some black people cause a disproportionate amount of crime yet note that some police are racist and see that there are bad and good cops and bad and good black people 
the american dream is that all men are created equal and thats men as in humanity not just males it is not that all men are equal and theres a big difference to note here you have the same opportunities as everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability and i do not know anyone myself included that is against governmental aid for the disabled 
what we have instead is the american nightmare where the left uses government and taxes for the most inane of causes trying to fix any disadvantaged groups lot real or imagined so that things will be better they take from the producers and give to the nonproducers so that according to their idealistic vision they will suddenly become productive members of society or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote democrat for the rest of their lives the good of the country over that of the individual 
long gone are responsible democrats like kennedy who told us to ask what you can do for your country every recent democratic president from carter to obama and most of the democrat congressmen view the working middle class of the country as simply a group to exploit for their pet special interest groups trump is the first candidate in a long time who isnt for the blacks or the gays or the muslims or the feminists or whatever and that matters a lot 
the reason why not being for a special interest group which is all that hillary is for with her youth vote black vote womens vote gay vote etc is so important is that these groups even put together do not matter when it comes down to the good of the country dont get me wrong theres plenty of good hardworking black people just like theres the same for women and for gays and for young people but these hardworking folks from all these groups arent going to be part of the blm or la raza or lamda because theyre too busy being productive americans activism is for unemployed people 
whats going to happen if we dont placate blm and just ignore them they riot a bit more and some get arrested what if we told them that people that commit crimes to protest being treated like they commit a lot of crimes is assbackwards thinking and counterproductive to their goals theyd quit rioting 
what would happen if we shut the mexican border down to illegal immigration but made a straightforward but strict path to citizenship for hispanics that wanted to be citizens what if we said this is america we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your children but the national language is english and all business and schooling will be done in it and in it only and its your choice to not learn it but the difficulties that will arise from that choice are all on you theyd be americans proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship as well 
what would happen if we told gay people that its cool if they have civil unions under the law and have the same rights as everyone else but its not cool trying to pick a fight with a christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their god and that youre sinning makes you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right 
what if we told them its ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult but you dont have to try to make fiveyearolds decide if theyre gay or straight when they shouldnt be wondering about that till puberty hits theyd be normal americans who just happen to like sex with the same gender and theyd quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our faces 
what would happen if we talked to muslims and said that there is a huge deafening silence when it comes to the subject of islamic terrorism from them that makes it hard to trust any of them what if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of its tacit acceptance and support of terrorism and part of that help means supporting us vetting muslims coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorists than people of other religions and ethnicities theyd go along with that and maybe realize were fixing a problem not hating a people 
what would happen if we told women that feminism has all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for falserape accusers both makes men not trust women and insults any real rape survivor what would happen if we told them that giving them jobs for their genitalia over their skills is destroying industries by lowering the only standard that matters that of merit that of excellence 
what if we told them that gender ratios and quotas may fix the macro view of sexism but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed as all hell towards women and when you do that to the majority of men youll be just as successful and just as hated by men as men were and were hated by you in years past theyd realize that its not a competition its a cooperation and maybe skill should be valued over sex 
what would happen if we stopped all these divisive issues that really dont do anything other than tear us apart and work on a better economy on rights for all on border security what would happen if we simply looked at each other as americans and put us all of us first what would happen if we ripped out the crap in the federal government that overtaxes people or deploys armed forces against our own countrymen what would happen if we made the supreme court constitutional again and made term limits a reality for congress maybe we could get a government for by and of the people again maybe america can indeed by great again like the man says conclusion 
im not in a special interest group no president outside of george w bush right after the september th attacks that i can recall since my childhood has been for me as an american ive always been someone to be taxed to be disarmed to be hated to be blamed its not racism or bigotry to want us all to be treated as equals and not be penalized for real and imagined wrongs that occurred in the past before i was born or more recently yet with which i had nothing to do

Jason Easley,2016-10-26T21:28:47.404+03:00,trump throws a fit when asked why he is promoting his hotel instead of campaigning,"by sarah jones on sat oct th  at  pm donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn a newly surfaced video via ryan grim shows the trump humiliation game in action which i walk everyone through from the pov of the woman share on twitter print this post 
if youre a woman whos worked in any business where youre forced to try to appease the massively sensitive ego of a sexually aggressive vulgar man in power you will know exactly whats about to happen in this video 
donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn and theres a newly surfaced video via ryan grim at huffington post that shows the trump humiliation game in action 
in the video trump publicly sexualizes and shames the  miss universe winner from australia jennifer hawkins as revenge before he does it trump tells the audience get even with people if they screw you screw them back  times as hard i really believe that 
watch this newly surfaced  corporate speech here via huffington post major trigger warning if youve been there 
watching this you see the trump modus operandi in action this is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning trumps advances the harassment as revenge the sexual shaming 
trump sets the audience up for the roman gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should screw people back if they screw you the sexually angry verb foreshadows whats to come because he is going to screw jennifer hawkins in public when she realizes that because its public she cant further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions 
trump says hes going to give them an example of his revenge theory jennifer hawkins 
trump orders hawkins to the stage the audience cheers and jeers delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl its to be a public spanking so much fun 
first of all how beautiful is jennifer trump asks claiming ownership of jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking the message he can make or break her she better play nice 
warning shot this is about getting even 
trump tells the audience that he was mad at hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in sydney he tells the audience how mad he was and then says as shes crossing the stage shes my favorite miss universe so she thinks maybe this isnt going to be as bad as she fears 
but then he stabs her publicly for the first time but i think i like the new one better 
the audience loves it he is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasnt a good girl she reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport 
hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing trump playing along with his game because she has to but there will be no easy way out of this one it wont be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience she will have to pay 
i was actually going to get up and tell you that jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside but shes not very bright trump tells the audience signaling that hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for 
that wouldnt have been true but i would have said it anyway trump proudly tells the audience this is his alpha male routine except in real life the alpha male doesnt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl but in the mind of little men like trump this makes him a winner 
trump points out that hawkins is a big star now but he helped her make it and then dissed him he owns her she must comply or face his wrath hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him but trump pushes her away from the microphone this public shaming will be done from trumps pov only no need for hawkins to assert her personhoodthere will be no defense allowed because shes already guilty 
and you know what she came tonight she came  came she came she came trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at christmas he waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming and they do they get it hee heee so clever came knuckles dragging on the floor clever 
see so they have the same filthy minds in australia trump says 
trump grabs hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her just like he bragged about doing on the bush tape 
hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them the kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek she is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact shes allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him and pretended to fawn over him as required but she will not cannot allow the kiss the repulsive kiss 
im telling this story as i imagine it to be from her point of view although she has refused to comment of course she refused to comment women are told they will be blackballed if they comment the world is full of men like trump and they stick together see roger ailes women have to play along and appease and if that doesnt work they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public especially if they said no in private 
i can only do this because i have lived it somewhat like this in public and i have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body 
from talking to so many women during this election i know that im not alone i know that many other women will watch this and know they will feel the creep of fear and revulsion the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest how dare hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce trump 
and other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it setting you up to be humiliated even more they will laugh about it and gossip about it which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like trump ironically if you give in youre not humiliated its only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object 
its not just the unwanted kiss although that is disgusting and assault much like donald trump bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape its the public humiliation and denigration 
its the way the woman is forced in front of thousands of people to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge 
its the way she tries to make it okay to sweetsmooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her come and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman 
in fact this is shades of what trump did to hillary clinton in the stalking debate after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed

automation in the workplace can bring new levels of efficiency and employee happiness but it can also mean that human workers lose their jobs in favor of robotic replacements no matter your stance on cuttingedge technology in the office there is no doubt that its a swiftly approaching reality according to a new study released by stanford university americans can expect over  percent of all workplace discrimination to be fully automated by  
the future is coming and its coming fast 
thanks to recent advancements in computer intelligence and predictive analytics it may not be long before you see an automated machine in your office demoting female employees for becoming pregnant whether humiliating subordinates with unwanted sexual comments or automatically filtering out résumés from people with middle eastern last names trends in technological development suggest that an increasingly computerized workforce will soon be enforcing inequality in office environments with far greater proficiency and costeffectiveness than human labor

K,2016-11-17T06:01:00.000+02:00,re why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money,"republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president
coming off of campaign events in florida tuesday and before he jetted off to north carolina to resume his quest for the white house trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the trump international hotel washington dc built in the citys historic old post office building
under budget and ahead of schedule so important we dont hear those words so often but you will said trump  linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country
 
related stories trump sets gop fundraising milestone in smalldonor contributions newt gingrich defends donald trump against sexual predator accusations donald trumps star on hollywood walk of fame vandalized trump also spoke as a developer not just as a candidate
my job is to look at undeveloped spaces and imagine what they could be he said these are spaces that have no hope no future but you need imagination and you need the ability to get them done and to unlock their potential and to unlock the potential of the people working on those spaces and on those projects and we have so many things we can do for our country
the united states is great he said its great its people are great there is no task or project too great there is no dream outside of our reach dont ever let anyone tell you it cant be done the future lies with the dreamers not the cynics and the critics
 
the fact that trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction

republican strategist steve schmidt  who helped sen john mccain rariz in his  white house race was among those who said trumps priorities were skewed
the walls are collapsing schmidt said referring to polls showing trump behind trump has discounted those polls as inaccurate and pointed to others that show him leading
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias he is not doing any of the normal activities that youd be doing  days out in a presidential race for somebody whos competitive you dont take a timeout to tend to your business interests he said
trump campaign manager kellyanne conway suggested that a dose of perspective might be useful
hes making a pit stop here in washington and his underbudget aheadofschedule hotel is really remarkable it shows americans the tangible accomplishments of donald trump hes somebody who builds things hes somebody who fixes things she said wednesday on nbcs today show
and you know respectfully hillary clinton has time to go to an adele concert and everybody thinks thats really cool donald trump stops off to unveil just an incredible stunning piece of architecture new hotel firstclass hotel and everybodys hair is on fire she said
conway dared anyone to find a candidate with a more active schedule than trump
hillary clinton took five days off to prepare for one debate and everybody looked at that as some kind of noble exercise with  days to go nobody covered that as where is she why doesnt she campaign much what is she doing where is she hiding conway said hes got the most active campaign schedule of the two candidates by far

Letsbereal,2016-10-26T11:23:00.000+03:00,no title,"lately gunfree zones and gun control laws are all the rage among the globalists and liberals of all shapes usually circular and sizes 
those measures solely aimed at disarming the people and depriving them of the sacred right to defend themselves has shown its vast ineffiency with gun victims and terrorist attacks on the rise in those zones since no honest citizen can shoot back to stop the massacre
here is why i propose once a conservative government reaches the white house to create fat control laws fcl and obesityfree zones ofz as obesity is indeed a more serious threat to the lives of americans than honest citizens carrying legally purchased guns here are six potential benefits
 simple philanthropy 
obese people are delusional thinking that it is great to be a useless sack of shit nowadays they get fed a distorted reality saying that big and round is beautiful when the natural reaction deeply branded in our dna is disgust mockery and suspicion
fat and sedentary lifestyles kill much more than guns  the war against obesity is as important as the war on crime or drugs bovine people not only harm themselves but others too by creating measures to prevent them from becoming fat or exhorting them lose weight we are helping our common man to preserve his dignity as a human being
in their case sugar and salt create a dopamine rush and an addiction loop very similar to an addiction to opiates we must show our potbellied or barrelbellied junkies the way as they cant take the steps themselves
just like with restrictions on cigarettes if they are stupid enough to gorge themselves on calories we must conclude that there is a severe lack of judgement on their part and prevent them from purchasing the source of their misery
 preserving aesthetics and other senses 
no more eyesore of seeing fatties rolling around everywhere you go imagine a beach with a plethora of more feminine attractive and thin women by banning whales in bikinis
our nostrils would also be free of the olfactory offence that they throw in our faces say goodbye to the pungent smell of fat rolls sweat at your local grocery store
no more lb sjw land whales with laboured breath sounds in waiting rooms or uncontrolled farting in the public transport like you are in a cattle train it could be tomorrow
 positive impact on children 
i do not want these people to roam free and that my future progeny can witness it and think that this is normal worse if the pc politburo tells them it is beautiful to be a beached whale lets send them far until they get better out of sight out of mind as they say
legal elements should be implemented against pernicious publicity aired on television and directly aimed at children whether by the time chosen to air it or the promotion it makes of unhealthy eating
of course with fat control policies kids will get bullied at school some will cut themselves for being called fattie so what adapt and overcome or crawl in a ball and cry the weakest has to be left behind if he does not want to save himself
 a healthier population you are under arrest for being an immovable gargantuan arsehole
fat is not a silent killer hundreds of thousands of people die with a loud thud every year of obesityrelated diseases a largely preventable cause of death worldwide today  in  americans and  in  britons dies from being a fat arse with no selfcontrol
it is a fact that obesity causes death by cardiac arrest diabetes coronary and liver diseases cancer and hypertension among others promoting a healthy lifestyle and physical activity will create a longer life expectancy
physically healthier people are mentally healthier too boost of selfesteem and confidence fat control laws will reduce mental health issues such as depression inferiority complex or suicidal tendencies caused by obesity that is also less money spent by the taxpayer
 a boost for the economy 
according to a  report ham planets cost the economy  billion a year  and that is for the american economy alone the number of human cattle is still growing exponentially it inflicted more than a  billion loss to the economy in 
in  we can reasonably assume that the number of obese people has grown and has impacted the wallet of your average american even harder
a fitter population with its nutritional choices would result in a more natural higherquality food industry smaller amounts of food produced and needed resulting in reduced resources and materials wasted during and after its production
we could see the end of excessive fossil fuel used to transport land walruses and their fat arse across long distances and hogging the space that could be use by three normal individuals
healthier more active people are happier more productive and successful since the cogs of the machinery are not coated in fat an age of stronger selfgoverned highenergy men bringing a healthier society its yuge
 a new sexual and romantic market 
it will bring a more balanced sexual arena to limit the accumulation of fat a radical answer to the phenomenon of plummeting testosterone levels caused by high fat percentage trimming the numbers of plump omegas and sexual market voluntary rejects
lets impose a healthier diet for higher numbers of attractive thin and pretty women greater numbers of quality girls to choose from reduces aggressive competition which decreases the bitch shields of thin entitled girls
endless supplies of betas queuing to capture crumbs of their attention would be a thing of the past as i said it before male thirst is the root of all evil when it comes to romantic competition
sexier citizens means more relationships a peak in libido and reproduction of physically and mentally balanced individual helping nations suffering from low birth rate
one more element for the protection of western society being the most affected one and its people cementing the bases of a strong future fighting globalism and the myth they try to sell us about global overpopulation
by logical natural process bronies corpulent manchildren and manga conventions should also disappear soon
the fat control laws  segregated obesityfree zones 
our diabetic mammoths must be isolated from further propaganda and tasty treats
this is why we should create large very large fenced areas to protect the healthy subjects as fat is more dangerous than guns
lets pen the bigboned rejects in separated zones where access to junk food and other harmful products would be forbidden fresh water open spaces salad and treadmills as far as the eye could see
build that fence
we shall call it the david fatrelle center for porcine rehabilitation
 permits 
a permit would have to be issued similar to a guncarrying permit for the purchase of junk food highcarb snacks soda drinks etc after a doctors physical exam of the patient slim citizens would be delivered a permit with a stamp of approval granting them access to supermarkets or venues where processed or junk food is served
 mandatory workouts 
compulsory exercise would be imposed to obese people to reach a standard bmi we could bring it up a notch where a fine could be issued after a determined period of time if the weight loss target has not been reached
a steps counter activity tracker would have to be worn or installed on their smartphone and a quota of physical activity would have to be reached on a day to day basis
just like the programs for convicted criminals or drug abusers with reports to the local police station on a regular basis the stubbornly chunky would be followed during a rehabilitation stage and their progress monitored
 fat shaming 
fat shaming works great as we have seen before  remember the shitstorm of the beach body campaign  immediately declared thought criminals by the body positive lobby or islamic thought tribunal of londonistan
or the coldblooded leaflets given by anonymous though criminals to particularly adipose london tube passengers yuge success
pourquoi ça nexiste pas 
fat people are a dead weight to society in all senses of the term and to compensate this burden they must chip in one way or another and repair the harm they cause
fitter people means a selfaware powerful mass that strives for greatness
but the liberals in charge dont want that this is why they produce massive amounts of harmful processed food and encourage the pleb by manipulating publicity and promoting makebelieve to remain fat weak and above all docile
its all part of a plan fat control laws are the answer to that great evil

Jason Easley,2016-10-28T22:03:41.265+03:00,trump wrecks any hope gop had of taking advantage of clinton email investigation,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on tue nov st  at  am last springnew york had to take legal action to collect  in unpaid taxes on the trumpowned company that owns the trademark boeing    
we looked yesterday at kurt eichenwalds revelation that donald trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails that is hardly trumps only misdeed but how many people realize that donald trump at this moment has   seventyfive  legal issues hanging over his head 
hes lying  to  times a day and has his followers  and with much less excuse the mainstream media  thoroughly distracted by the clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities 
usa today reported at the end of october that just two weeks before election day at least  of the plus lawsuits involving trump and his businesses remain open according to an ongoing nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by usa today 
it will surprise no one because trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster  that one trump case over nonpayment of tips to caterers at trump soho hotel in new york city is scheduled to go to trial a week before election day 
if one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that trump does not pay his bills earlier we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts having decided that the contractor had been paid enough even though it wasnt the agreedupon amount trump got nailed by the court for k in attorneys fees in that case 
just a few examples from usa todays investigation 
trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses angry members at his jupiter fla golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment theres a fraud case brought by trump university students who say the moguls company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign a disgruntled gop political consultant sued for  million saying trump defamed her another suit a class action says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages 
as pointed out by usa todays nick penzenstadler and john kelly these lawsuits will dog trump into the white house should he win he will have no immunity because he is president and america  and the world  will be treated to the spectacle of the president of the united states having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs 
there are harassment cases sex discrimination lawsuits fraud unpaid bills racist comments defamation cases involving trump university as usa today notes as recently as last springnew york had to take legal action to collect  in unpaid taxes on the trumpowned company that owns the trademark boeing  that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country 
and those  cases will likely grow 
trump has promised after all to sue the new york times and each of the women  nymag maintains an exhaustive list  who have accused him of sexual assault 
usa today says it spent six months researching court records the exclusive analysis they say found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits the cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the white house 
donald trump claims clinton is tainted he claims clintons emails are bigger than watergate the other day tweeted  we must not let crookedhillary take her criminal scheme into the oval office draintheswamp 
this comes from the man who would turn the  pennsylvania avenue into a morality nogo zone

thats offensive to me that kind of language its not our operation indiana governor mike pence said friday morning on msnbcs morning joe  
yes donald trumps republican running mate mike pence has finally found something hes offended by but its not donald trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting african americans or mexicans or women or a gold star family 
nope 
did pence read the story no but hes offended so offended because that kind of language is offensive not the actual suppression of the votes but the language because its not our operation 
watch here via msnbcs morning joe  
twice saying he hasnt read the article pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadnt read thats offensive to me that kind of language its not our operation pence denied 
donald trump and i want every american who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election and thats our message is to tell the american people that this country really belongs to them that we can have government as good as our people again but its going to take all of us 
and you saw donald trump  say that people who havent traditionally voted republican weve got an agenda to bring our cities back 
pence is twice offended so super offended 
ive never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way frankly you know it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because thats just not the approach donald trump has taken to this campaign its not the approach were taking were reaching out to every american 
pence then claimed independents and even democrats are breaking for trump in fact trump and pence are even losing groups that voted for mitt romney in  pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame republicans into voting for them by saying its time for republicans to come home because trump won the primary 
mike pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done because its just not what i see out there 
trump also loves to cite what he sees and reads and often times those things turn out to not even exist  like videos he claims to have watched 
this explains why mike pence and donald trump ended up together it turns out they are not that different after all in spite of the republican establishments efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise both pence and trump dont care a whit about facts this is more than typical campaign spin its appalling in context 
the context is that mike pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a womans pssy without her permission but he is publicly saying hes offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts 
pence didnt even bother to read the article which suggests that he doesnt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters but why would he 
pence didnt care about any of the groups donald trump insulted  not enough to take a public stand so why start now but he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign 
like trump pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior

by caleb stephen 
posted friday october   at am edt 
keywords fallout  nuclear  nuclear attack  nuclear attack survival  nuclear bomb  nuclear bomb survival  nuclear power  nuclear radiation  nuclear war  nuke  radiation  survival  tactical nuke with the ongoing tensions between the united states and russia fears of a nuclear world war  breaking out are running at an alltime high 
with that in mind i thought it needful to write an article on how to survive the aftermath of a nuclear fallout obviously we could discuss the likelihood of such an event occurring but that isnt within the scope of this article personally i believe that at this point in time such a scenario is not at all far fetched however the situation is very fluid and thus things could change at any time 
basically theres two main types of nuclear weapons out there first youve got what is known as the tactical nukes and then the intercontinental sort  the stuff that would basically flatten the earth in that case theres no point even trying to survive that im going to be talking about how to survive a tactical nuke incident  dont be anywhere near ground zero 
obviously the first step to surviving the initial explosion is to not be there in the first place of course theres not a ton that you can do if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time youve just got to hope that you exit this world pretty quick  which would most certainly happen if youre anywhere close to ground zero 
the tremendous heat and sheer force of the explosion is enough to kill anyone and flatten anything within an  km radius of the detonation site the intense thermal radiation emitted by the flash of light at detonation is enough to blind you burn your flesh and start fires in the impact zone 
if youre outside when this happens and you happen to survive you should take immediate cover in a building if you get any debris on you you should wash it off with soap and water as soon as possible 
as a survivor of the initial explosion you now have around  to  minutes to bail out of the area before a lethal amount of radiation fallout comes down from the mushroom cloud in those  minutes you need to get at least  km  mile from the blast zone to survive the fallout however within  hours lethal radiation will spread with prevailing winds so keep moving to safety you should feel for the wind and begin running perpendicular to it  not upwind or downwind  getting to shelter 
if you cant get out of ground zero for whatever reason then you need to get to shelter as soon as possible get into the deepest underground basement that you can find or the highest story above the th level if possible 
if you are in the fallout zone but safely sheltered you need to remain there for at least  days during this time food and water should be carefully rationed and clothing layered up to prevent radiation 
really the best way to survive a nuclear event is to prepare for one 
remember the nuclear fallout shelters of the cold war era well thats what you need to be inside to survive but not just any shelter its got to meet a number of different specifications which i am not going to go into because you can find plenty of information on that if you google how to build a nuclear fallout shelter etc  personal protection measures 
protecting your body from harmful radiation and fallout particles is your number one priority after getting to shelter 
like i said before being prepared prior to such an event is very important which is why its a good idea to carry the gear im going to talk about shortly inside a go bag that you can keep in your car house or workplace 
some quick first aid tips it is necessary that all wounds should be covered to prevent contamination and the entry of radioactive particles any burns caused by radiation must first be washed and then normal burn first aid procedure should be followed 
now lets look at the gear you should have ready before a nuclear attack happens 
gas mask youll need a gas mask to protect your face and respiratory system from airborne pathogens and chemical particles israeli military surplus m gas masks fitted with nato  mm cbrn filters are some of the best and cheapest around yet are getting harder and harder to find these days with huge supplies flying off the shelves in the relatively recent ebola scar i have the m civilian version of this gas mask and its extremely comfortable has a port for a hydration tube and best of all its been tested in real life conditions in the middle east 
military chemical suit these suits provide optimal protection from chemical and biological attacks and are used by the british army these are surprisingly cheap yet are proven to work by soldiers whose lives depend on them in everyday combat situations you can get these for around  from amazoncom 
gloves youre going to need gloves to protect your hands from contact with chemical pathogens and biological particles long chemical resistant gloves can be found online at some supermarkets and hardware stores you can get these at around    depending on the brand etc 
boots in order to have full protection from chemical and biological hazards it is important to have a good pair of rubber overboots to protect your feet and legs from chemical and biological particles from coming into contact with your body ensure that you blouse your trousers inside your boots for maximum protection once again these boots that i recommend are used by the uk military and you can get them on amazoncom for around  
nuclear protection there is a way to reduce the effects of nuclear radiation in your body its called potassium iodide and its available on amazon for less than  for a pack of  tablets what this basically does is it reduces the chances of harmful radioactive iodine from entering your thyroid glands 
if you dont have any of these when a nuclear attack happens you can improvise as i mentioned before clothing should be layered up to prevent radiation contact with the skin cover your eyes with closefitting sunglasses or improvised goggles 
 decontaminating food and water 
water and food will be contaminated by debris from the nuclear fallout making procurement and consumption difficult however it is not impossible to make them safe to consume 
whenever possible try to use water that has been sealed in a container or bottle as you can safely assume that the water inside the sealed container is not contaminated wash the container thoroughly with soap and water or boil it for at least  minutes before breaking the seal if water in sealed containers is not available your next choice only under emergency conditions is water from springs again boil the water for at least  minutes before drinking keep the water covered while boiling to prevent contamination by airborne pathogens 
your last choice only in an extreme emergency where sealed water and spring water are unavailable is to use standing water that found in small pools ponds and basically any water that does not flow contaminants microorganisms and germs can survive easily in stagnant water first boil this water as long as practical to kill all organisms next filter it through a cloth to remove the nasties 
in all cases mentioned above use water purification tablets following all directions on the bottlepackaging after boiling and initial filtration prior to consumption 
like water you can also assume that sealed containers or packages of processed food are safe to ensure safety decontaminate all food containers by washing with soap and water or by boiling the container in water for  minutes this is where it helps to have a decent supply of sealed buckets and containers of militarystyle mres and freezedried foods such as wise foods and mountain house 
you should consider supplementing your sealed rations with local plants animals and produce only in extreme emergencies unfortunately no matter what you do to prepare or decontaminate the food there is no guarantee that cooking will kill all the biological agents 
remember you can survive for a long time without food at least  weeks but can be longer especially if the food you eat may potentially kill you 
if you must use local food select only healthylooking plants animals fruit and vegetables do not select known carriers of organisms such as rats or other vermin always use gloves and protective clothing when handling and dressing animals plants etc cook all plant and animal food by boiling only boil all food for at least  minutes to kill all pathogens do not try to fry bake or roast local food as there is no guarantee that all infected portions have reached the required temperature to kill all pathogens do not eat raw food at all costs 
obviously this article is nowhere near comprehensive but i hope it gives you some idea of what you need to do in order to survive the aftermath of a nuclear attack we can only hope and pray that such an event does not happen and that peace will prevail on this planet you might also like",english,legorafi.fr,No Image URL,satire,Fake,révélations françois fillon serait de droite le gorafi,nili nathan posted friday october edt keywords autism vaccines robert de niro vaxxed robert de niro autism vaccines unvaxxed vaxxed answer evident film festival attendees shocked robert de niro enormous pressure pulled film vaxxed tribeca film festival others may need see vaxxed first see unvaxxed new film awardwinning author filmmaker dr leonard g horowitz contributes discussion actor robert de niro sought prompt screening controversial film vaxxed tribeca film festival new york de niro whose son like millions children became vaccineinjured came fire sides vaccination safety debate pulling vaxxed event agents pressured hollywood celebrity censor film producer del bigtree director andy wakefield de niro later pledged investigate caused censorship unvaxxed docucommentary robert deniro overall grand jury winner cinema los angeles film festival takes place annually central los angeles november nd saw trailer filmmakers dr leonard horowitz sherri kane promise continue dialogue contribute questions actor robert de niro asked interviewed today april wanted answers investigation autism controversy around vaccines see unvaxxed docucommentary robert deniro world international film festival wiff november playing crest theatre westwood blvd los angeles ca tickets visit venues website httpwwwcrestwestwoodcomeventscinemalosangelesunvaxxedadocucommentaryforrobertdeniro bio dr leonard g horowitz taken website dr leonard g horowitz worlds prolific best credential controversial drug industry whistleblower awardwinning author filmmaker pharmaceutical industry critic intelligence industry analyst published seventeen books dozens peer reviewed scientific articles dr horowitzs first three american bestsellers emerging viruses aids ebolanature accident intentional largely credited prompting global vaccination risk awareness movement book caused several governments reconsider immunization policies became center political debate barack obamas minister rev jeremiah wright credited horowitz book evidencing hivaids genocidal weapon mass depopulation targeting africans african americans courtesy covert us military contractors named publication dr horowitzs second bestseller healing codes biological apocalypse prompted revolution music natural healing industries retired dentist naturopathic physicians consumer health guidebook healing celebrations miraculous recoveries ancient scripture natural medicine modern science pioneered protocol adopted thousands natural healers doctors worldwide,0.0

facebook  twitter november   manosphere 
there are those who think we should only get our news from official sources you know like the blonde telling you what to believe in between hocking a hockey game 
if theres anything the  election showed us its that the american people are increasingly distrustful of and not listening to the commands laid out by the once mainstream media theyre increasingly reticent to commit national and demographic suicide under the guise of diversity and other nebulous ideals theyre desperate not only to drain the swamp but to restore some sense of national pride and stability to the declining usa 
in response the controllers of the presstitutes the people who really run the world are already hard at work trying to find some way to create a false narrative about fake news sites in order to lay the ground work for censorship and control the internet has all but destroyed the corporategovernment narrative and there is a shit fit happening at the highest levels of the propaganda ministry ie cnn abc cbs nbc et al because they have learned the american people know how full of shit they really are 
sites like return of kings are on the front lines of this war in support of free speech and it is vitally important we stay on top of our game to avoid a reversion to the managed propaganda the centralized control of mass media gave us over the last  years hackers and leakers play right into the hands of the censorship narrative 
make no mistake one of the reasons leakers of misdeeds done by politicians and the elite they work for have been allowed to continue leaking dirty laundry is because it plays into the hands of those with designs on censorship and regaining control of the information the sheeple get to listen to having julian assange and edward snowden doing leaks of information and giving them extensive press coverage plays right into the hands of the censorship brigade because they can also play the protecting national security game when the time to silence dissent comes  
fake news is only the first assault in what is sure to become a full scale war on free speech on the internet we can be thankful trump won the election rather than the bitch since his election will slow the process of censorship but the aggressiveness of the fake news narrative shows us how determined some people are to shut us up and shut us down 
the new york times is already on the front lines of this assault on free speech on the internet only days after the bitch lost the election publisher arthur sulzberger published a mea culpa and promised to rededicate the newspaper to honest reporting 
we cannot deliver the independent original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers the new york times promises to give the news impartially without fear or favor we also approach the incoming trump administration without bias 
dont buy into it this is whats known in public relations as a diversion tactic while we focus on our seeming victory theyre already moving on to their next false narrative  socalled fake news no sooner than the ink dried on the promise to give trump a chance the new york times was moving to shut up the very people who made possible his rise to power  the altright and alternative news web sites 
while some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the balkans or entrepreneurs in the united states seeking to make money from advertising false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere 
they did a spurious case study on how a rumor got started about protesters being bussed in to protest at trump rallies never mind the mainstream media is a business that runs lock stock and barrel on fake news almost every narrative they create is a false one one need do no more than a google search to discredit many if not most of the mainstream medias stories the hypocrisy is astounding pulling the plug facebook censorship algorithms are nothing compared to the elites agenda of eliminating free speech online 
whether or not the fake news narrative gains traction the next step will be for the elite to create a problem that affects millions of people online then follow through with the hegelian dialectic with a preordained solution to make everyone safer online and to stop the spread of false information while protecting free speech online by destroying it 
look for no less than a figurative internet  if the elite become desperate enough 
theyll pull the plug on the backbone of the internet shutting down ecommerce and communication online for a few days blame it on a fake news story just like benghazi was blamed on a youtube video then spring in to save us from ourselves by passing all sorts of creative laws and restrictions aimed at nothing more than eliminating competition to the corporategovernment narrative and gutting yet another of our bill of rights protections 
make no mistake freedom of speech is the most important of amendments to the constitution once that is taken away its game over obama has already floated the idea of silencing those of us who cling to our guns and religion and continues this narrative even after the election of trump 
obama has already been floating the idea of official news web sites this is nothing more than proposing the creation of the american equivalent of pravda in the soviet union in which only the stateapproved newspaper was considered the truth and everything else was considered lies obviously the new world order socialist narrative would be the only truth under a system such as this and traditional and conservative views would be relentlessly silenced 
check out what the messiah said in berlin recently 
in an age where theres so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a facebook page or you turn on your television where some overzealousness on the part of a us official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made then we wont know what to protect if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems 
the fact he is saying these things should frighten you it should also make you angry this statement is a pc way of saying the goal of the power structure is to shut us the fuck up they want us to listen to clueless journalists who encourage the idea of microchipping your children and later yourselves so every aspect of your life can be controlled by the government

Sean Colarossi,2016-10-27T02:47:11.477+03:00,former gop congressman goes full trump encourages armed revolt if clinton wins,"trump warned his supporters that the us postal service is trying to steal the election for hillary clinton in colorado 
video 
at a rally in golden co trump said 
i have real problems with ballots being sent does that make sense 
like people saying oh heres a ballot heres another ballot throw it away oh heres one i like well keep that one 
i have real problems so get your ballots in 
trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about hillary clintons emails 
donald trump appears to be losing his mind he also seems to think that accusing the us postal service and election officials of stealing the election for hillary clinton is going to motivate republicans to vote 
consider the contradiction in trumps message the republican nominee tells his supporters that the us postal service is throwing away ballots while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots 
if their ballots are going to be thrown away by usps why should republicans bother mailing their ballots in 
it is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense trumps inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why republicans on pace to lose this election

Jason Easley,2016-10-27T18:37:48.144+03:00,trump campaign admits they are trying to steal the election with voter suppression,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat oct th  at  pm that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released   
coming from people who believe in something called spiritual warfare a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions  it is perhaps no surprise that the religious right should declare that their messiah  donald trump  is being threatened with witchcraft 
lance wallnau whose twitter page claims to be your spiritual warfare guide to the  election appeared on the jim bakker show to push the crazy idea that many christians feel this fog on their head at times and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
watch courtesy of right wing watch 
oh sweet baby jesus the mighty lance has struck out what has happened of course is that the religious right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion its no wonder they feel in a fog  metaphorically or physically theyre selling their souls 
wallnau claims the left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of christ who doesnt work together and thats the dilemma that americas in right now even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the religious right has been organizing since goldwater lost in   
a hypocrite just cant catch a break it seems 
the web literally is coming down on america and whats sad is how many christians feel this fog on their head at times do you feel that its almost like everythings going wrong we dont realize its a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the american culture and discipling the country and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
wherever theres agreement theres power the more unbelievers agree with the narrative that theyre hearing the more power and authorization satan has to manifest so unless the church has an exposure of what the enemys doing and begins to agree together with a counterstrategy were going to deal with more and more fog and the worst part iswe dont have to surrender nations to the devil 
so if you disagree with wallnau if you oppose trump it can only because youre manifesting the power of satan who in the old testament is gods lieutenant not his adversary so pick your testament i suppose 
lance wallnau insists he is not a big conspiracy theorist buff but this doesnt do anything to convince us hes not some wackadoodle instead this is nothing new as a nonchristian being told that you represent a devil you dont even believe exists 
there are  years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize or worse their opponents 
without charges of satanism and witchcraft you dont have the genocide of european and middle eastern paganism you dont have antijewish pogroms and you dont have the crusades or the spanish inquisition you dont have witchburnings 
what this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that were not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents 
not only do they deal in a conspiracyladen world a world free of facts but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason  and lets go ahead and say sanity  do not 
lets face it donald trumps biggest enemy is not satan but donald trump himself and wallnau can claim believers have an edge all they want but all the belief in the world wont overturn reality",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Paul-Ryan-Trump.jpg,bias,Real,donald trump tanking trump supporter waves hillary noose doll rally,jason easley sun oct th republicans hoped fbi director james comeys letter new clinton related emails would swing election new series cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping lead within points trump arizona share twitter print post cbs news republicans hoped fbi director james comeys letter new clinton related emails would swing election new series cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping lead within points trump arizona battleground tracker found small margin comeys letter made democrats likely net support clinton individual battleground states clinton leads eight points pennsylvania north carolina colorado state four polled trump small two point lead arizona according cbs news larger demographic difference defining race clinton donald trump gender gap slightly larger last time states offsets smaller movement republicans trump put another way hillary clintons support women going larger rate republican movement towards trump first swing state polls taken since fbi director comey released infamous letter friday email story isnt moving voters reinforcing partisanship election democrats going vote clinton republicans going vote trump arent enough undecided voters swing election trump republicans hoping hail mary touchdown save trump clinton continues lead critical states little week go election day comey letter big october surprise isnt working voters hillary clinton maintains swing state leads comey email letter flops added jason easley sun oct th,1.0

thursday october   by david gutierrez staff writer tags superbugs  drug resistance  tasmanian devils naturalnews milk from tasmanian devils and other marsupials may be a natural cure for antibioticresistant infections suggests a study conducted by researchers from the university of sydney and published in the journal scientific reports the researchers found that the milk contains no fewer than six compounds capable of killing some of the worlds worst superbugs unlike placental mammals including humans which gestate their young within the mothers body marsupials give birth after just a few weeks to highly immature offspring  mobile fetuses essentially  that still need to complete significant development in their mothers pouchin particular the immune systems of newborn marsupials are highly underdeveloped because a marsupials pouch is a significantly less controlled environment than a placental mammals uterus researchers wondered if newborn marsupials might need  and get  an extra immune boost six times as potent as human milk a previous study conducted in  cataloged many of the microbes that naturally make up the microbiome of the tasmanian devils pouch these included several diseasecausing organismsthere are potential pathogens present in the devil microbiome so the fact that the underdeveloped young in the pouch dont get sick was a clue something interesting was going on coauthor emma peel said thats what inspired our most recent studyfor the new study the researchers analyzed the tasmanian devils genome for genes coding for antimicrobial peptides called cathelicidins they found that tasmanian devil milk contains six different types of cathelicidinfor comparison human milk with all its antimicrobial and immuneboosting properties contains just a single cathelicidinthe researchers artificially synthesized the peptides then tested them against several known superbugs including methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and enterococci the peptides killed every type of microbe they were tested against although the researchers had expected to find some antimicrobial effect the potency of the peptides surprised themwe showed that these devil peptides kill multidrug resistant bacteria peel said which is really coolmany marsupials have even more cathelicidins in their milk than tasmanian devils wallabies have eight for instance while opossums a western hemisphere species have preliminary results have also shown that similar antimicrobial peptides are found in koala milk the global threat of superbugs although mrsa has gotten most of the media attention other superbugs such as enterococci can also be highly dangerous these bacteria  which like mrsa often naturally occur on or in the human body  can cause infections at several different sites while such infections are minor if treated enterococci are growing increasingly antibiotic resistanthealth experts were alarmed recently when more strains of enterococcus started turning up resistant to the antibiotic vancomycinvancomycin is a pretty potent antibiotic and if a bug is resistant to that then there arent a lot of drug options available to you peel saidmargaret chan directorgeneral of the world health organization recently called antibiotic resistance a fundamental threat to human health development and securityand the united kingdoms review on antimicrobial resistance recently concluded that unless urgent action is taken to stem the spread of drug resistance  superbugs will kill  million people annually by  thats more than the combined death toll of cancer and diabetesshockingly that review estimated deaths from only six varieties of superbug klebsiella pneumoniae e coli mrsa hiv tb and malariaresearchers estimate that today superbugs kill only  people a year the number is expected to rise so dramatically due to the spread of drugresistance genes through microbial populations combined with the ongoing evolution of resistance to new drugsthe review on antimicrobial resistance also failed to estimate the deaths that would come from people being unable to gain medical care such as surgery or cancer treatment that

khan has insisted that his antigovernment protests would continue until the sharif administration offers an appropriate response to the corruption allegations

Mike Rivero,2016-11-21T03:44:07.262+02:00,the death of john kennedy,"print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov  
first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you 
second im not endorsing donald trump in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate 
third i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore 
fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st donald i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see john  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation 
fifth my decision to vote for trump barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if trump won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once trump became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary for two strong warnings about hillary see here and here  
so what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump 
the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected 
second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote 
third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole 
fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home 
fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for trump 
sixth trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president 
seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority 
so in sum  my hope is in god not donald trump and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil 
in the end if trump gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice 
either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive michael browns

every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the democrats coincidentally the democrats have brought in another  to  million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades 
it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate in  workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in mitt romney this year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross 
the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top  percent the rest of us will be their servants 
the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society 
look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them 
explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family 
one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing 
when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces  this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing 
as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants 
thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling 
and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation 
immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled 
in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling 
somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing 
in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack 
when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack 
 two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july   
 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online july   
needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegalalien gang rape at all 
the ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome 
by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex 
those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican 
that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team 
similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment 
perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good 
manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher 
our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe

get ready for the most heartwarming story youll read all day 
if you met paul langdon or ayesha qamar on the street you might think they have nothing in common paul is a retired firefighter ayesha is a law student paul has lived in the same suburb of columbus for his entire life ayesha immigrated to ohio from pakistan when she was a teen paul is a devout christian ayesha is muslim but if you dig a little deeper youll find that they share a common bond both paul and ayesha have trump painted on their garages 
beautiful take a look at the sidebyside pictures above to see just how similar these two really are 
when donald trump announced his campaign last summer paul knew he wanted to show his support by painting a large sign of the candidates name on his garage door but paul probably never would have guessed that one year later just a few towns over from him ayeshas own garage would be painted with literally the exact same word paul and ayesha may be from totally different walks of life but when it comes to the name currently painted on their garages these two have more in common than they ever could have imagined 
at the end of the day it doesnt matter whether their skin is white or brown it doesnt matter whether they worship god or allah and it doesnt matter whether the word trump has been carefully lettered or hastily scrawled across the garage in brusque spray paint all that matters is the commonality they share in having the word trump painted on their homes for the entire neighborhood to see 
amazing it just goes to show you should never judge a book by its cover

Noah Beck,2016-11-02T06:45:44.129+02:00,the hostility and hypocrisy of leftwing israeli ngos,"fbi investigates saudi wifeabusing clinton foundation donor in straw donor scheme november   daniel greenfield 
its midnight in america and the clintons and the democratic party keep finding ways to cover themselves in glory im sure the line on this will be that the fbi is acting inappropriately by investigating this investigating political corrupt ion interferes with corrupt politicians being elected 
the fbi is investigating an alleged illegal donation scheme involving a wealthy saudi family that supports democratic florida senate candidate patrick murphy 
murphy who has covered himself in glory so often already is denying everything and i mean absolutely everything 
the murphy campaign declined to say whether the candidate is aware of the fbi probe 
whats your name i decline to answer that question 
murphy  is running against rubio the incumbent republican in a race that could help decide which party controls the senate in  rubio currently leads murphy by an average of  percentage points according to realclearpolitics 
the fbi investigation however relates to murphys first run for the house in the  campaign cycle 
the allegation  originally submitted by a republican super pac run by a former top aide to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky  is that murphys high school friend and major political donor ibrahim alrashid coordinated a straw donor scheme to boost murphy 
murphy knows nothing 
murphys campaign declined to say whether murphys attorneys had discussed the fbi investigation with alrashids attorney 
uhhuh 
alrashid is the son of a powerful and politically connected saudi billionaire hes been a major financial benefactor of murphys giving almost  to his campaigns and to outside groups supporting the florida congressman 
heres how some of these donations worked 
one example within the alleged scheme a woman who describes herself in federal donation reports as the owner and property manager of a texasbased company limestone property management gave murphys campaign  
but she is neither the property manager nor the owner of the texasbased company in fact she doesnt work there 
she lived in miami at the time and was ibrahim alrashids cleaning lady according to a miamidade police department report filed in  over a home burglary at alrashids property 
texas property manager vs saudis cleaning lady thats quite a difference 
murphy has been forced to return alrashids donations before for purely islamophobic reasons 
alrashids three sons have followed in their fathers political footsteps contributing large sums to top democrats including rep patrick murphy d fla whose senate race could help decide which party controls the senate in  
murphy has already returned a portion of alrashids donations due to his involvement in a domestic assault incident 
ibrahim alrashid allegedly forced his way into his estranged wifes pennsylvania home where alrashid allegedly grabbed her by the wrist struck her about the head and face with a closed fist then threw her to the ground according to a copy of the police report viewed by the free beacon 
following the  incident alrashid allegedly sent his wife a text message stating i am not sorry this time i hope you die in hell according to the police report 
murphy a longtime friend of alrashid was recently forced to donate around  in campaign funds to domestic violence groups after the assault charge became a public liability for the campaign murphy also returned all of the donations made by alrashid during the last three political cycles 
is the clinton foundation involved in this do the clintons do their business in golden and marble toilets 
nasser alrashid one of saudi arabias wealthiest figures and an adviser to the countrys royal family has donated somewhere between  million to  million to the clinton foundation putting him in an elite category of prominent donors

  raw food  cooking  vegetables naturalnews to cook or not to cook has been a topic of heated debate among some health food advocates raw food junkies claim that eating foods in their most natural state is the answer to all our issues and diseases cancer included they believe that cooking destroys essential vitamins live enzymes and antioxidants vital to our healthwhile nobody will dispute the fact that adding more raw organic fruits and vegetables to our diet is essential for overall health and wellbeing going raw all the way isnt always the best option either a study published in the british journal of nutrition found that people who followed a strictly raw food diet had normal levels of vitamin a and betacarotene but low levels of the antioxidant lycopene as reported by scientific american  high lycopene levels have been associated with a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks according to rui hai liu an associate professor of food science at cornell university lycopene may be an even more potent antioxidant than vitamin c it seems that some vegetables need a little heat to release their plant goodness most plants have a tough cellular structure lightly cooking these food makes it easier for the body to break down the plants thick cell walls making nutrients more available for absorption read on to discover six foods that are healthier cooked  asparagus lightly cooking asparagus spears makes it easier for the body to absorb cancerfighting vitamins such as vitamin a c and e as well as folate furthermore higher levels of antioxidants ferulic acid in particular have been reported when this vegetable is cooked  carrots betacarotene is the compound that gives carrots their vibrant orange color the body converts betacarotene to vitamin a which is vital for vision reproduction bone growth and immune healthcarrots however are sturdy vegetables and dont give up their nutrients that quickly to get the most out of your carrots researchers at the university of arkansas advise that higher levels of betacarotene are obtained when carrots are cooked  mushrooms according to andrew weil md mushrooms are indigestible when they are uncooked he said that thoroughly heating them releases the nutrients they contain including b vitamins proteins and minerals as well as compounds not found in other foods  pumpkin and other winter squash not many people will eat raw pumpkin unless it is put through a juicer  and that is just fine since cooked pumpkin has been shown to be more nutritious just like carrots pumpkins need a little heat to break down tougher cell walls and release their plant goodness  spinach folate vitamin c niacin riboflavin and potassium are more available in raw spinach however slightly cooking spinach increases the levels of vitamin a and e fiber zinc thiamin calcium iron and protein  as well as essential carotenoids such as betacarotene lutein and zeaxanthin  tomatoes while cooking tomatoes reduces vitamin c levels it also makes lycopene more available to the body as mentioned earlier lycopene has been linked to a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks vitamin c is an abundant vitamin so it is well worth the lossas you can see raw isnt necessarily always best however if you love tomato or spinach salads and cant stand them cooked that doesnt mean you should stop eating them raw whether you enjoy your

were confident that hero is a grandslam movie that will build up families across america and restore luster to the game said joseph farah wnd founder and ceo 
starring burgess jenkins of remember the titans and nashville and gregory alan williams of miracles from heaven this awardwinning movie brings the love of baseball to hearth and home it also features a powerful music soundtrack by threetime grammy winner michael omartian 
get every boy needs a hero now at the wnd superstore from the producers of alone yet not alone the movie is a powerful tale of restoring and strengthening relationships between fathers and their children 
according to dr ted baehr founder of movieguide  hero is an excellent movie about god turning a mans heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father 
dr baehr added the opening is powerful the ending is heartrending the drama the acting the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie this is one of the few movies that movieguide can actually say go see it keith harris and nick edwards as wynn and sammy heller 
hero opens with joe played by burgess jenkins coaching his son davids baseball team the gappers to the state championship seven years later after pursuing his dream job joe returns to town he had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family his wife hannah is stricken with cancer while david is angry that joe left them after hannahs funeral joe moves back into the house but david remains bitter meanwhile david is coaching the now hapless gappers the team loses more than it wins joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners hoping this gesture will help joe reconcile with david unfortunately the league rules have softened dramatically making it nearly impossible to train the team properly practice times are limited coaches cant make players take laps around the field everyone gets a participation trophy the beloved american pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games let alone practices so joe starts his own league to turns things around 
from the director of isaiah  judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero a beautiful tale of the significance of the fatherchild relationship thats and set around americas pastime baseball 
one of the fathers joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison mr redding played by gregory alan williams reddings career mirrors that of joe hes been offered a big job in washington dc like joe hes lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family in contrast another gapper teammate has a father whos actually a prison inmate under redding unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son but he cannot due to prison rules justin miles and burgess jenkins as david and joe finn in the film every boy needs a hero 
what makes hero particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself 
watch the trailer 
washington times reporter bradford richardson wrote in his article study blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players that the austin institute a texasbased think tank focused on family and societal issues has commissioned a study titled called out at home which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball 
from the director of isaiah  judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero a beautiful tale of the significance of the fatherchild relationship thats and set around americas pastime baseball 
richardson writes 
kevin stuart executive director of the austin institute said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because it takes two to play catch 
there is a longstanding connection between fatherhood and baseball mr stuart said pointing to famous fatherson tandems who have played in the major leagues and the prominence of fatherson relationships in popular baseball movies such as field of dreams 
baseball he said was made to be played by fathers and sons 
baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle where whats really necessary or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you mr stuart said 
anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the studys connection between fatherhood and baseball 
famous fatherson tandems  including ken griffey sr and ken griffey jr prince fielder and cecil fielder and tony gwynn sr and tony gwynn jr  have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next 
hero received a powerful endorsement from renowned christian author stormie omartian 
for such a time as this hero is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball farah said 
baehr concluded hero is a wonderful faithfilled sports drama it will touch your heart your mind and your soul gapper team dads from the film every boy needs a

two bill clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the clinton foundation  and even called the arrangement bill clinton inc 
doug band a top clinton aide detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company teneo and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked emails released wednesday by wikileaks 
teneo partners have raised in excess of  million for the foundation more than  million of which is in the bank the memo reads 
teneo partners also have generated over  million in paid speeches for president clinton  million of which has been paid to him thus far 
the consulting company was formed by band and former state department envoy declan kelly the memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president 
in one arrangement kelly introduced bob mccann the head of ubs wealth management to clinton at an event in  
after the meeting mccann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting clinton to give several paid speeches 
another arrangement involved the laureate foundation which donated more than  million to the clinton global initiative 
laureate was a personal advisory services business the memo said paying clinton ?million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman 
the cozy relationship with the clintons put the baltimorebased laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe 
the band memo also includes a section about forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc 
some of the speeches secured by teneo include two  addresses delivered to ubs in  and  as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches if he chose to give them 
another secured event was a  million fee for clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in hong kong the fee included  for a private plane 
since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements the memo reads 
the relationship between band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter chelsea clinton in another email 
chelsea specifically called out band and teneo for hustling business opportunities out of the foundation 
i continue to want  and to try  to disintermediate myself from this muddle edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in  while also being a responsible board member daughter and person chelsea wrote in the  email

Caroline Glick,2016-10-28T07:55:02.971+03:00,checkmating obama,"search zineb el rhazoui charlie hebdo survivor discusses why the world needs to destroy islamic fascism undeterred by fatwas and death threats the author has released an incendiary and thoughtful new book bound to provoke debate october   
reprinted from nytimescom 

she leads a clandestine existence on the move and under hour guard as frances most protected woman yet zineb el rhazoui the charlie hebdo journalist who happened to be in casablanca on january  last year the day terrorists avenging the prophet massacred nine people at the satirical magazine in paris believes she has a duty to defy islamists desperate to silence her 
shaken but undeterred by the fatwas and relentless precise death threats issued via social media to kill the bitch since she helped produce the publications first survivors issue following the attack  and spoke about it in arabic for the arab press  the moroccanfrench writer refuses to assume an anonymous identity fleeing paris or abandoning her human rights activism and her unforgiving critiques of the religion she grew up with are also out of the question 
i dont have the right to renounce my struggle or to give up my freedom says the reporter and sociologist of religion in an interview with women in the world during a recent trip to new york as part of french president francois hollandes delegation when he received the appeal of conscience foundations world statesman award for  if the french state protects me it is not little individual me what is being protected is my freedom to be irreverent and freedom of expression so i should exercise this even more because i enjoy this protection 
its totally crazy i have done nothing against the law and have nothing to hide yet i live with security while those who threaten us are free el rhazoui declares with an air of shock and anger that underscores the arbitrariness and brutality visited on a yearold woman condemned to living on the run and mostly in the shadows and if you call them by their names you are islamophobic and racist i am racist i can teach them a few things about arab culture i can show them how to discover its richness and the diversity of their culture i believe this culture deserves universality because you can be arab muslim and a free thinker 
resisting terror 
sweeping in to the offices of women in the world in manhattan accompanied by bodyguards the worldrenowned journalist is living proof of her pledge to keep living her life beyond its limits as a key way of resisting terror elegant and beautiful with her long wavy hair flowing freely and in an impeccably tailored black dress el rhazoui is reminiscent of s cinemas cerebral heroines  her eloquence and composure only occasionally betraying the trauma of the past  months each time we speak about the aftermath of the massacre at her magazine and how she is coping personally her voice quavers but when the subject comes back to her fight for reform in islamic civilization she is fearless 
in this spirit el rhazoui obliged to spend most of her time in hiding like salman rushdie after his  publication of the satanic verses  has taken the highrisk option of publishing an explosive new book about islam 
detruire le fascisme islamique  destroy islamic fascism  being released in france this week takes the battle of ideas directly to the ideologicallydriven zealots who inspired the assassins of her dear friend charb stephane charbonnier late editor of charlie hebdo who preferred to die standing than to live on my knees 
obtained exclusively by women in the world the book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam by imitating the first salafists or pious ancestors the prophet mohammed and his companions whose violent exploits are contained in bellicose texts from a barbaric thcentury bedouin tribal context exhibited codes of behavior el rhazoui insists have no place in the modern world and can be directly connected to terrorism the most abject crimes of islamic state are but a stcentury remake of what the first muslims accomplished under the guidance of the prophet she writes noting that sexual and domestic slavery the massacre of nonmuslims notably jews pedophilia pillage polygamy and summary executions were all adopted from preislamic societies the book is also the journalists way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere  with islam no exception to their traditional french anticlerical ridicule  through satire and caricature 
formerly the magazines religion writer el rhazoui is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management flush with cash from international donations the fundamentally altered publication she disappointedly explained  will probably never again draw the prophet  out of fear of more reprisals 
and those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of mohammed forget that everywhere that islam reigns as the religion of the state caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed el rhazouis book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam religion of peace and love 
we need to admit that islamism today is applied islam el rhazoui  who describes herself as an atheist of muslim culture writes responding to politicians religious figures islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that real islam has nothing to do with such terror 
when we apply islam to the letter it gives islamism and when we apply islamism to the letter it gives terrorism so we need to stop saying islam is a religion of peace and love what is a moderate islamist an islamist who doesnt kill 
the essaylength book is in the grand french polemical tradition of emile zola whose jaccuse denounced the antisemitism of the french state and establishment during the dreyfus affair on the eve of the th century el rhazoui who holds moroccan and french citizenship takes aim at a very stcentury phenomenon what she abhors as the intellectual fraud of islamophobia which pretends to be about antiracism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all muslims epitomized by the french collective against islamophobia ccif this deliberate strategy vilifies as islamophobic voices such as el rhazouis who dare question the religion the ccif and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism 
the notion of islamophobia doesnt even exist in muslim countries the author points out because outside the west criticism of the religion or mohammed is officially categorized as blasphemy 
unable to pass blasphemy laws in europe groups like the ccif employ a dangerous semantic confusion she said on the ccif site it is written islamophobia is not an opinion it is an offense 
this is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards islam and muslims yet criticism of an idea of islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime i was born and lived under the islam of morocco and live in france and i have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of islamophobia that says i have no right to criticize if we criticize christianity it doesnt mean we are christianophobes or racist towards the christian race 
the widespread pressure to selfcensor is severe el rhazoui says 
you can no longer speak about islam without saying its a religion of peace and love but when you open any book in islam what do you find violence blood oppression of women and hate for other religions 
of course you can find this in other religions however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity as long as we dont talk about this and keep repeating that islam is a religion of peace and love many people will continue to believe the koran is a constitution and that rather than being a book written  centuries ago reflecting a particular context it is a legal constitution to apply today 
zineb el rhazoui feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead charlie hebdo comrades 
after completing high school in morocco el rhazoui studied languages and the sociology of religion obtaining a masters degree from pariss prestigious social science graduate school ehess in her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at le journal hebdomadaire becoming a campaigner for secular liberties such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of ramadan this act of nonviolent resistance earned her her first fatwa ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the arab spring in  the wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against ramadan rules prompted her to leave morocco again for france where she began to report for charlie hebdo bringing her memories of having vomited up compulsory religious classes in a country where being muslim is not a choice unless youre jewish or christian 
extreme personality cult 
socalled islamic fascism seen in its most extreme form in groups like isis shares characteristics in common with all extremeright fascisms el rhazoui argues because it combines an intense personality cult around mohammed as the incarnation of the nation it also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation exemplified by sartorial branding  for example burkinis or niqabs  that allow for immediate identification and targeting of nonadherents there are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals armed militias adoption of a flag and a strategy that confers the benign status of muslim women to heavily veiled adherents in the west and characterizes them disingenuously as victimized objects of exclusion 
the literary corpus of islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma el rhazoui writes 
if the terrorists of daesh isis behead those they judge to be miscreants that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the th surah of the koran alanfal verse  remember what your lord revealed to the angels  i am with you so support those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve you can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip 
you can be arab muslim and a free thinker 
drawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of islams core arabic texts the politics of the postarab spring middle east and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multifaceted islamic civilization el rhazouis book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politicoreligious repression dead 
the greatest racism is el rhazoui argues the racism of the islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not muslims and that rejects women that is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it the writer adds 
today islam in the world only has a role as a civilization a civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion  but also by its geographical heritage its artistic culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature 
the muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today universal principles of equality between men and women sexual and individual freedom and equality for all no matter your creed or religion until islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it islam will not be acceptable 
islamophobia whiners 
destroy islamic fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and fauxintellectual fakery the authors word of islamophobia whiners and other collaborationists from across the political spectrum  particularly the hard left cryptoislamist antiracists on a quest for a new muslim proletariat certain feminists cultural relativists and socalled moderate imams all these willing accomplices do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of islamic state the author says but also makes the lives of millions of muslims living in islamic countries downright miserable 
what do these islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in islamic theocracies and dream of liberty el rhazoui concludes in her book who speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of algiers casablanca or cairo in a skirt those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it  about homosexuals pariahs of muslim societies who often only have the choice of death prison or exile who speaks about this youth born muslim but dreaming of a normal life these teens attacked for having had a romance 


the summer furore over burkini bans in france agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of islamists and their western sympathizers in the media academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of liberation and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by muslim women even though most never wear it 
western media in an intolerable readiness to oblige have defended the burkini as a freedom and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity she said but pointed out that in muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with burkinis but they are emptying themselves of women from one year to another they are disappearing from the public space because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior 
as for mainstream or moderate muslim clerics el rhazoui tells women in the world that during the burkini debate in france not one imam stood up and said hey wait a minute you can be muslim and wear a regular bathing suit 
history will judge those who have monopolized the debate given a platform to islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability the author of destroy islamic fascism told women in the world this is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today she said 
according to the writer who is repeatedly accused of bigotry the islamophobia ruse is driven by great ignorance and a lack of understanding of the culture of islam and what islam with a big i is  they ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within 
the accomplices dont recognize the struggles playing out today in arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people no fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history the people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability 
for el rhazoui the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to islamic culture that decrees an islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her race is the burqa we present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture it is absolutely intolerable she says 
survivor syndrome 
women in the world asked el rhazoui how she manages to keep up her spirits and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since january  
it is a question people often ask me she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice but when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death you realize can put many things in perspective 
straight after the attacks like many of my colleagues i felt guilty for having stayed alive i said to myself those who are dead are dead for all our work and some are dead when it wasnt even their work but it was my work because i am a journalist and i am still here and then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome which is normal when you survive a massacre like that 
as you start to heal you say i am lucky to be alive and if i am still here perhaps that is because i still have something to do i understood long before the attack on charlie when i engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in morocco that when you fight against totalitarianism whether it is political or religious you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living we fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life 
zineb el rhazoui c attends the funeral of french cartoonist and charlie hebdo editor stephane charb charbonnier on january   in pontoise outside paris martin bureauafpgetty images 
still a day doesnt go past when she doesnt think of her old colleague charb and their many heated discussions 
he was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear he was a true humanist who didnt fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd 
el rhazouis deconstruction of islam is also a defense of muslims she reasoned as salvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it 
we have to extend a hand to all these muslims who are free people who have questioned their heritage and who are fighters for liberty battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by islamists she says 
life in a moving jail 
since january  the survivor from charlie hebdo has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the freedom forum in europe and the us under the protection assured by the french state and the countries that receive her she says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed because so many other writers and political figures around the world  and especially in islamistcontrolled or influenced countries  are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security 
i always find some spaces of freedom there are always little escape hatches life continues says the woman who has just written her second book since the charlie attacks and recently became a firsttime mother in what she laughingly called the surprise baby boom at a publication that used to have one of the lowest birthrates in french media 
today i wander around in a moving jail  its a moving cage  but in reality i am more free in my head than those who threaten me because their cage is inside their head they have this cage in their brain and even if they have freedom of movement it is their spirit and their reason and intelligence that is imprisoned i am much freer than them

Infowars Nightly News,2016-10-28T01:12:00.266+03:00,after vets fight war feds demand money back,"bill clintons son danney williams has youtube channel restored youtube had deactivated channel hosting popular documentary linking williams to bill clinton infowarscom  october   comments 
youtube has decided to reverse its ban on a channel registered by a man who claims to be bill clintons longlost son 
your youtube account was suspended due to repeated or severe violations of our terms and our community guidelines and as such cannot be restored the company wrote earlier this week to danney williams after he filed an appeal to restore his channel 
for decades williams has been on a mission to reunite with the person he believes to be his biological father the nd president of the united states william jefferson clinton 
the most popular video on the channel  a nineminute minidocumentary posted two weeks ago produced by filmmaker joel gilbert features the yearold williams recounting memories from his childhood which prompted the search for his father 
arguing the channel had absolutely zero violations of any kind gilbert places blame for the suspension squarely at google and the clinton campaigns feet 
its obvious to me that the fix is in gilbert wrote in a statement the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danny to run him off the plantation as danny said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  
youtube later restored williams channel early thursday morning claiming a review confirmed it was not in violation of its terms of service 
last week danney went to las vegas  the site of the third us presidential debate  where he held a press conference alongside his lawyers announcing his intention to seek a dna sample from bill clinton in order to settle the paternity dispute 
danney and his lawyers claim a previous dna test carried out by the tabloid star magazine failed to obtain a blood sample from clinton an assertion confirmed by one of stars former editors to world net daily  
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna former star magazine editor phil bunton stated to wnd

Letsbereal,2016-10-26T17:50:00.000+03:00,no title,"the most interesting books of the bible for those who arent believers in god are the wisdom books of job and ecclesiastes written from a philosophical point of view they attempt to help people live with suffering and pain while putting existence into context
book of job 
job is a devout believer in god who follows all of his rules he has been blessed with incredible wealth and numerous children satan then challenges god by arguing that job is only faithful because of what he has gained and that he would immediately curse god if everything was taken away from him god allows satan to destroy him taking his wealth and killing all of his children
once the misfortune befalls job his wife implores him to curse god but job refuses instead he openly laments at why god is allowing him to suffer he even asks god to allow him to die
i would rather be strangled
rather die than suffer like this
i hate my life and dont want to go on living
oh leave me alone for my few remaining days job 
why make me your target
am i a burden to you
why not just forgive my sin
and take away my guilt
for soon i will lie down in the dust and die
when you look for me i will be gone job 
what do you gain by oppressing me
why do you reject me the work of your own hands
while smiling on the schemes of the wicked job 
he then has a series of poetic dialogues with priestly men in an attempt to explain gods justice job asks some pointed questions implying that those who are eager to sin seem to experience more prosperity than those who closely follow gods words
the godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine
its branches spreading across the garden
its roots grow down through a pile of stones
it takes hold on a bed of rocks
but when it is uprooted
its as though it never existed job 
when a plague sweeps through
he laughs at the death of the innocent
the whole earth is in the hands of the wicked
and god blinds the eyes of the judges
if hes not the one who does it who is job 
just like how there are so many laws in the legal code that you are always on the hook for something illegal there are also so many possible sins that it may be impossible to live a clean life
whatever happens i will be found guilty
so whats the use of trying
even if i were to wash myself with soap
and clean my hands with lye
you would plunge me into a muddy ditch
and my own filthy clothing would hate me job 
the men that job spills his guts to state that hes sinning in some way and knows nothing about how god works and that he must grin and bear it instead of questioning gods actions
pay attention to this job
stop and consider the wonderful miracles of god
do you know how god controls the storm
and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds
do you understand how he moves the clouds
with wonderful perfection and skill
when you are sweltering in your clothes
and the south wind dies down and everything is still
he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror
can you do that job 
god appears and asks job how dare he question his actions even though those actions amounted to an agreement with satan
who is this that questions my wisdom
with such ignorant words
brace yourself like a man
because i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth
tell me if you know so much
who determined its dimensions
and stretched out the surveying line
what supports its foundations
and who laid its cornerstone
as the morning stars sang together
and all the angels shouted for joy job 
god goes on to describe his powers and then serves a how dare you argument to job who then accepts his utter impotence
then the lord said to job
do you still want to argue with the almighty
you are gods critic but do you have the answers
then job replied to the lord
i am nothinghow could i ever find the answers
i will cover my mouth with my hand
i have said too much already
i have nothing more to say job 
you asked who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance
it is iand i was talking about things i knew nothing about
things far too wonderful for me
you said listen and i will speak
i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
i had only heard about you before
but now i have seen you with my own eyes
i take back everything i said
and i sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance job 
other parts of the bible channel job by asking why bad on earth is allowed to continue
wake up o lord why do you sleep
get up do not reject us forever
why do you look the other way
why do you ignore our suffering and oppression
we collapse in the dust
lying face down in the dirt
rise up help us
ransom us because of your unfailing love psalm 
and the usual response is to not question god
what sorrow awaits those who argue with their creator
does a clay pot argue with its maker
does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it saying
stop youre doing it wrong
does the pot exclaim
how clumsy can you be
how terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father
why was i born
or if it said to its mother
why did you make me this way isaiah 
after job stopped questioning god he was rewarded with even greater prosperity than before
so the lord blessed job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning for now he had  sheep  camels  teams of oxen and  female donkeys he also gave job seven more sons and three more daughters he named his first daughter jemimah the second keziah and the third kerenhappuch in all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of job and their father put them into his will along with their brothers job lived  years after that living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren then he died an old man who had lived a long full life job 
you have to be patient with god
those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy they weep as they go to plant their seed but they sing as they return with the harvest psalm 
the lesson of this story seems to be one of stoicism accept your fate dont question it and understand that what you have now can be taken from you at a moments notice if god wants to no matter how cleanly you have lived in his honor ironically this book did more to make me question gods wisdom than any other
book of ecclesiastes 
the next wisdom book is ecclesiastes purportedly written by kings david son solomon who amassed onethousand wives during his reign as king of israel his wife collection led to him serving other gods and he was punished for it when god broke up the kingdom of israel ecclesiastes is the book that solomon wrote at the end of his life sharing all that he learned
everything is meaningless says the teacher completely meaningless what do people get for all their hard work under the sun generations come and generations go but the earth never changes the sun rises and the sun sets then hurries around to rise again the wind blows south and then turns north around and around it goes blowing in circles rivers run into the sea but the sea is never full then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea everything is wearisome beyond description no matter how much we see we are never satisfied no matter how much we hear we are not content history merely repeats itself it has all been done before nothing under the sun is truly new ecclesiastes 
what is the point of accumulating wisdom in life why work hard
for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow ecclesiastes 
i thought wisdom is better than foolishness just as light is better than darkness for the wise can see where they are going but fools walk in the dark yet i saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate both will die so i said to myself since i will end up the same as the fool whats the value of all my wisdom this is all so meaningless for the wise and the foolish both die ecclesiastes 
so what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety their days of labor are filled with pain and grief even at night their minds cannot rest it is all meaningless ecclesiastes 
all is vanity
for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again ecclesiastes 
promiscuous and bad women are sent forth as a punishment from god
i discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death her passion is a snare and her soft hands are chains those who are pleasing to god will escape her but sinners will be caught in her snare ecclesiastes 
solomon tries to convince himself that evil will not prosper but he cant help coming back to the fact that it does
when a crime is not punished quickly people feel it is safe to do wrong but even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time i know that those who fear god will be better off the wicked will not prosper for they do not fear god their days will never grow long like the evening shadows and this is not all that is meaningless in our world in this life good people are often treated as though they were wicked and wicked people are often treated as though they were good this is so meaningless ecclesiastes 
at this moment it seems that solomon goes off the rails by seemingly promoting a life of debauchery
so i recommend having fun because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat drink and enjoy life that way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work god gives them under the sun ecclesiastes 
one interpretation of this is that if you live in sin like solomon you will eventually come to the conclusion that life is meaningless all is for naught and the only purpose is to have fun the book may have been included in the bible to serve as an example of what will happen to you if behave as solomon and come to the end of your life thinking that it wasnt worth it i hope this was the intended result because otherwise it would cause you to lose faith in gods own wisdom in justice just like with job
the wisdom books of the bible raise questions of gods justice and plans for his human subjects why do people suffer or prosper why does life feel like its not being guided by god these questions vexed the jews enough that they honored other gods to get more immediate results and then jesus christ came along to say that it will all be worth itnot necessarily now but in the eternal afterlife as long as you accept him as your savior

Brian Gerard,2016-11-05T19:01:12.583+02:00,why do people become cuckservatives,"were all about selfimprovement here at return of kings a man should always be seeking to improve himself in some fashion and when he has achieved one goal he should move onto the next one in short never rest on your laurels
combining this desire for self improvement with the masculine independence and minimalist lifestyle that other writers on this fine website should inculcate in you a desire to improve yourself while being thrifty and relatively solitary as this article deals with fitness you know what im going to say personal trainers or at the very least the ones at your average commercial gym should be avoided at all costs and while most longterm fitness enthusiasts and professionals will likely either train by themselves or have one of the few trainers that knows what hes doing most of us have to train alone especially beginners who have naught but common sense to light his path but there is another option books 

yes books that simple yet elegant method of transferring knowledge directly to its viewer there are certainly plenty of books out there pertaining to the various fields of fitness and athletics but the question remains how effective is a book in physical training
as an avid reader of fitnessrelated tomes and many others but thats neither here nor there i own many of these books and i feel that their effectiveness can be judged by grouping them based on genre
weight lifting and calisthenics when i first started getting into physical culture as a young teenager i turned to the nearby commercial gym as most tyros tend to in that commercial gym i quickly found myself being attached to a wellmeaning jackass who gave me a machineheavy program that according to him would develop strength size and endurance and like most naive young men i followed him developing none of those things but lining the trainers pockets
eventually realizing that i had been lied to i embarked on a search for enlightenment coming to the various corners of the internet that deal in such interests one of the first things that i came across were books that i have repeatedly referred to in these pages and still consider to be some of the best writing on general fitness out therethe works of men such as paul wade and pavel tsatsouline upon reading books such as power to the people and the convict condidtioning series and using a bit of common sense i deduced that these books were superior than the typical tomes on fitness that the commercial gyms would sell at the counter for a few reasons
one they advocated a physical philosophy of simplicity and purity rather than advocating a julienne of exercises their routines were efficient and targeted all muscles of the body two the credentials of the men were a cut above the average writer as a maximum security convict and a spetsnaz veteran respectively i knew that these men needed to train their muscles to fighting trim for purposes of survival rather than doing curls for the girls and third they referred to the strongmen of old like maxick and eugen sandow standing on the shoulders of giants and opening my eyes to the wider world of fitness writing much of which i have further consumed
in general i would argue that writing on weightlifting and calisthenics are the most effective books on fitness as these are solitary activities and the books are typically written by one man speaking to another man thus the techniques there in are written to be easily understood and practiced by the user without a partner

martial arts as i have repeatedly stated on this website  martial arts in general should be taken with a massive grain of saltwhile im not so stupid as to say theres no point in training any sort of refined fighting style because of adrenaline and yes i have seen this boneheaded argument made i have also spent a substantial amount of time debunking the overly flowery and outright fictitious martial arts styles that many hack authors and filmmakers propagate on my own website as well as my youtube and dailymotion channels sadly thanks to martial arts being more or less an unregulated market in the united states any clown has the full legal right to proclaim himself a master
with that being said some martial arts books are effective thoroughly explaining the proper mechanics of a move andor explaining proper situations in how to use them while i have a background in proper study i have also utilized books to teach aspects of martial arts that i was not formally taughtsuch as grappling and again i sought out accomplished and legitimate fighters that were decorated in their field men like farmer burns  lessons in catch wrestling and physical culture  and masao takahashi  mastering judo  wrote detailed and efficient books for fighting in the clinch and i have also used dr sang kims books on taekwondo such as complete kicking for learning some of the more exotic kicks that my own background didnt teach me and of course i practiced on resisting opponents some of whom had been wrestlers themselves and thus could shore up my technique
the most important thing to bear in mind when using a martial arts book is that you must practice these techniques against a bagdummy at the very least and preferably with a sparring partner that will put up a fight and while this is also the case for any book on physical culture i would argue that its the most important for martial artsnamely because martial arts techniques are by definition used in panic situations in contrast weightlifting is almost always done in a state of relative calmnessnot counting the fake screaming idiots use to pump themselves up

mindsetmeditationetc books such as the kundalini meditation manual by yogi bhajan which i have only recently started to use are simultaneously the most simple and most complicated books on selfimprovement to use they are simple because in very basic terms the advice they give is basically think really hard about something but it is precisely that abstractness that can make them difficultmeditation is a nebulous concept for the best of us to grasp immediately and in some ways changing ones mindset and behavior is the most difficult thing anybody can do
while i admittedly do not have the depth of knowledge in these that i do with the other two topics i would say that these are hard to grasp but easy to practice once they have been grokked in the words of anthony burgess after all every second of every day of your life will involve you utilizing your mindset and thus its difficulty lies in the original understanding

conclusion looking at these three broad genres of male selfimprovement books we can see that they differ greatly in content but speaking from a position of experience i can safely say that to a great extent they are effective and they can teach you new things but only if you get one of the relatively few books that arent written by armchair alpha males and only if you diligently practice the information contained within them

juror  vigorously defends the acrosstheboard acquittals of ammon bundy and his six codefendants calling the rulings a statement about the prosecutions failure to prove the fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge 
the fulltime marylhurst university business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jurys deliberations in the case questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror no  who the judge bounced from the jury a day later 
it should be known that all  jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count itself  and not any form of affirmation of the defenses various beliefs actions or aspirations juror  wrote friday in a lengthy email to the oregonianoregonlive 
he expressed relief that he can now speak out freely but he wasnt ready as of friday morning to drop his anonymity he said his studies have suffered since the trial started and hes not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict the judge withheld jurors names during the jury selection process and trial instead referring to each by number 
the jury closely followed us district judge anna j browns instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the fiveweek trial he said 
the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the us fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation 
juror  noted the panel couldnt simply rely on the defendantsdefining actions to convict 
all  agreed that impeding existed even if as an effect of the occupation he wrote 
but we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind the marylhurst student wrote it seemed this basic high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout 
prosecutors had argued that the case at its core was about the illegal taking of anothers property the heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the day takeover in and of itself was intimidating and prevented officers from the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management from carrying out their work they said 
they argued that the alleged conspiracy began nov  when ammon bundy and ally ryan payne met with harney county sheriff dave ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didnt step in and block harney county ranchers dwight hammond jr and steven hammond the hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on jan  and serve out a mandatory minimum fiveyear sentence for arson on federal land 
defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mixup the effect of the occupation  which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs  from the intent of the occupiers 
five of the seven defendants including ammon bundy testified many said that they were there to protest in support of the hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change 
the defense lawyers arguments coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence resonated with jurors juror  noted 
inference while possibly compelling proved to be insulting or inadequate to  diversely situated people as a means to convict the juror wrote the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us nor was it warranted given their burden of proof 
juror  plainly stated that fellow juror  during the initial round of deliberations had zero business being on this jury in the first place 
juror  had worked for the us bureau of land management as a ranch tech and firefighter more than  years ago he had said during jury selection asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts he said not really 
juror  explained why he didnt alert the court immediately after he had heard juror  on day one of deliberations reportedly say i am very biased 
it wasnt until the fourth day into deliberations that juror  sent a note to the court asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was very biased could be an impartial judge the court flummoxed by the development a day later dismissed juror  for good cause after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal at the time parties to the case werent sure which way juror s alleged bias fell 
juror  said he resisted the impulse to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself 
in his email to the oregonianoregonlive juror  for the first time also contended that juror  violated the judges explicit orders by hearkening to evidence that was never admitted in this case refused to consider the defendants state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions 
juror  said though he wishes that he had sent the letter on day one since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us 
the maryville business student said he is baffled by what he described as observersflippant sentiments in the wake of the jurys acquittals 
dont they know that not guilty does not mean innocent he wrote it was not lost on us that our verdicts might inspire future actions that are regrettable but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us 
the jury he said met with judge brown after the verdicts were announced and after the us marshals physical confrontation and arrest of bundy lawyer marcus mumford 
he said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the conspiracy charge he said he learned that a potential alternate charge such as criminal trespass wouldnt have brought as significant a penalty 
the charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison 
we all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this conspiracy charge seemed the best possible option juror  said

an email published by wikileaks on friday reveals the extent to which democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends 
the  email appears shows democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results 
fyi we are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll sample too small otherwise operative tom matzzie wrote to clinton adviser paul begala campaign chairman john podesta media matters for america founder david brock and operative susan mccue good begala responded 
trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant hillary lead over trump have been manipulated through selective sampling there is ample evidence that this occurs in democratfriendly newsrooms 
hillary clinton has opened up a point lead over donald trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the democratic nomination last week the daily mail reported in june 
but the weekly tracking poll from nbc news and the surveymonkey company included the opinions of  percent more selfidentified democrats than republicans  the same margin as the polls topline result the article noted 
the email released by wikileaks friday proves that democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics 
polls are a powerful propaganda tool and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidates loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on election day

the leader of yemens houthi ansarullah movement says saudi arabia commits crimes across the globe with the us green light 
abdulmalik alhouthi said on wednesday that the al saud family has adopted a hypocritical approach in the muslim world the proof of which is takfiri violence gripping the region 
when washington gives the riyadh regime the green light sedition sparks in all countries with the saudi offensive being in line with such a trend he added 
the houthi leader also warned that saudi arabia is seeking to damage security in some arab countries such as egypt yemen syria and iraq through petrodollars and deceptive propaganda works 
instead of countering the enemies of islam including the us and israel the kingdom has been engaged in spreading takfiri ideology and arming terrorists houthi noted 
saudi has yemenis blood on its hands 
on october  in one of the deadliest attacks yemen saudi warplanes bombarded a funeral hall packed with mourners in sanaa killing over  people and injuring at least  others 
human rights watch a new yorkbased rights group said that the sanaa bombing constitutes an apparent war crime while amnesty international said the attack was a reminder of the need for the suspension of arms sales to saudi arabia people inspect the aftermath of a saudi airstrike in sanaa yemen october   photo by ap 
saudi arabia committed crimes by the sanaa attack but it tried to acquit itself of the assault houthi said adding that there was no clear sign suggesting an end to the saudi offensive 
he also stressed that yemenis cannot rely on the united nations as the world body has not adopted a position regarding the saudi attack in sanaa 
houthi further wished victory for the palestinian nation and the resistance front in lebanon and syria as well as the iraqi people in their antiterror operation in the city of mosul 
the riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on yemen on sunday hours after a threeday truce in the conflictridden country expired

Truth Detector,2016-10-31T12:28:27.453+02:00,comment on if clinton goes down loretta lynch will go down with her by truth detector,"posted by michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

senior white house officials blocked the navy from conducting needed freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea amid growing concerns that china is militarizing newly reclaimed islands according to the pentagons defense policy board 
a working paper produced in september  by john hamre the policy board chairman called for an immediate resumption of navy warship passages to prevent china from taking over the strategic southeast asian waterway 
the internal document was disclosed monday by wikileaks as part of its latest batch of hacked emails from the account of john podesta campaign chairman for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton the obama administration has accused russias seniormost officials of hacking and leaking the emails posted to wikileaks and other sites in order to influence the  election

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-26T08:50:00.000+03:00,jewish pirates of the caribbean,"search election law violation was hillarys idea orders to use donald duck to foment violence at trump rallies came straight from the top october   matthew vadum 
democrat hillary clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against republican donald trumps campaign according to top democrats appearing in undercover video 
in the third hillaryrelated video released by acorn slayer james okeefe and his project veritas action fund this past sunday oct  clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use donald duck to mock trump and troll his supporters at trump campaign rallies 
among disney cartoon characters donald duck was a natural choice after all his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when bill and hillary clintons favorite community organizing group the nowdefunct acorn hired hobos and felons to go on voterregistration drives 
earlier this year democrats in donald duck costumes started appearing at trump events across america costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs one said trump ducks releasing his tax return 
this cutesy publicity stunt isnt necessarily the problem though the problem is that hillary clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a taxexempt nonprofit group 
prominent in the video is political organizer robert creamer who is very high up in the democratic partys hierarchy he has reportedly visited the obama white house  times including  meetings with obama personally 
one of the visits took place in obamas personal living quarters 
its a very big deal that creamer visited the presidents residence in the white house a former senior white house employee told frontpage in an interview white house employees can work there for years and never visit the residence 
creamer a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by marxist community organizing guru saul alinsky is husband tof rep jan schakowsky dill a socialist and advocate of singlepayer health care creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of obamacare he also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for  months but he got off with merely five months and  months of home confinement from a friendly democrat judge 
creamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm democracy partners  the list of partners on the companys website is a whos who of elite democratic party power players 
in addition to creamer the partners are 
midwest academy founder heather booth  website developer marc cerabona  organizer wyatt closs  seiu veteran mac dalessandro  maccabee group founder brett c di resta  crosscurrents foundation cofounder ken grossinger  former media matters for america online organizer david grossman  former seiu national field director for politics john hennelly  strategic communications advisor marilyn katz  organizer jackie kendall  strategist lupe lopez  political consultant mike lux  strategic advisor josie mooney  consultant patrick pannett  organizer christine pelosi her mother is house minority leader nancy pelosi usaction president khalid pitts  former dnc general counsel joe sandler  consultant linda saucedo  fundraiser renee schaeffer  former new organizing institute senior fellow joel silberman  and organizer cheri whiteman  
listed as associates are lauren windsor  executive director of american family voices and aaron black  who appears in the undercover videos black describes himself in the footage as basically deputy rapid response director for the dnc on the ground at trump events adding nobodys supposed to know about me 
frontpage published an article yesterday examining democracy partners 
for a master practitioner of fascistic tactics creamer is amazingly lacking in selfawareness or just plain dishonest he wrote a fatuous ahistorical oped in the huffington post earlier this year titled can fascism triumph in america 
like other fascist movements trump says out loud  and legitimates  the kind of hateful violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of peoples living rooms 
bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of trumps public statements creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents 
fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteiling or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers ditto for mussolinis squadristi black shirts maos red guards irans basij  and haitis tonton macoute  
creamer explains the donald duck action in the third video 
in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground creamer says in one of several exchanges so by god we would get ducks on the ground 
creamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm democracy partners and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said dont repeat that to anybody 
the whole duck thing that came about the reason we moved it from dnc to americans united for change was to just do a hopscotch but the actual idea was hatched way back in may creamer associate scott foval said making a pun 
the duck has to be an americans united for change entity creamer said this had to do only with some problem between now acting dnc chief donna brazile and abc which is owned by disney because they were worried about a trademark issue thats why its really silly 
we originally launched this duck because hillary clinton wants the duck in any case so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff so that was fine so we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage and trump taxes and then abcdisney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was donald ducks his taxes releasing his tax returns 
creamer is shown in the video hoping disney would file a lawsuit against democrats for using donald duck in the campaign likely because such a thing would generate publicity 
let them sue us please god he says looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer i doubt they will because were paying to rent or buy the suits thats where they get their license fees were not using it for commercial purposes 
the wall street journal reported aug  that donald ducks was the creation of the democratic national committee then on sept  the paper reported the dnc is no longer associated with the duck  americans united for change is now managing the duck  
but out of public view the dnc and the clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation breaking federal campaign coordination laws okeefe says in narrating the third video 
we kind of divvy up responsibilities so sometimes it will be like campaign owned said jenna price assistant press secretary at the dnc so sometimes you will see that they advised something or they are taking credit for things so like we arent taking credit for the duck anymore thats like random ally groups but its still something that were involved in 
brad woodhouse president of americans united for change expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence i think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere 
in one segment foval says i almost got punched on monday morning i mean i was in a duck costume 
the nations campaign coordination laws were enacted after president richard nixons watergate scandal okeefe notes 
for an activity to violate the law it must meet a threepart test he explains 
first there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for electionrelated activity second a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group and third electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election 
okeefe continues 
the payment prong of the test is complicated but just the fact that foval a paid employee of americans united for change was the duck at some events constitutes payment by aufc conduct based on their own admission the campaign creamer their agent and aufc coordinated the duck activities and finally content donald ducks is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another 
the fourth video released yesterday isnt so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of creamers ties to the clinton campaign and to president obama himself 
in a phone call creamer says i spend most of my time overseeing the trump events around the country i mean thats what i do for the clinton campaign uh so thats interesting as well 
in another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in syria creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to obamas inner circle 
i just need to i will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then okay  on the first well ill just talk the guy im going to talk to first to see if this is up his alley the first thing is up his alley its the guy who ran the campaign for president obama he has a firm thats pretty well connected 
in another setting creamer says 
heres what i do for the clinton campaign by the way im a consultant to the clinton campaign wherever trump or pence go in the country we make sure that there are press events in the tv market or whatever  whether theyre big turnouts or little turnouts whatever that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message so that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places so our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day so it is a lot of events and we try and help define the other candidate 
every morning i am on a call at  that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters added creamer 
he continued 
im in this campaign mainly to deal with what you know earned media with the television radio with earned media and social media not with paid media not with advertising there would be a whole different advertising  everybody is driven on the same tracks though so then there are a couple a bunch of people in the brooklyn office of the clinton campaign that are responsible for possible aspects of communication like we do rapid response and there is a guy there i work with heavily is the guy that i was just communicating with on that kind of stuff for instance we just found i just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said my understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about trump this afternoon 
creamer bragged again about his ties to president obama 
oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect 
obama is a pro creamer said ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago 
i was just at an event with him in chicago actually on friday last he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues 
the second video  released oct  was a primer on how democrats get away with massive voter fraud 
its a very easy thing for republicans to say well theyre bussing people in said scott foval then national field director for americans united for change 
well you know what weve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin assholes for  years and were not going to stop now  were just going to find a different way to do it so i mean i grew up with that idea they used to bus people out to iowa if we needed people out there wed bus people out to iowa 
in a discussion okeefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally foval who also worked as deputy political director at george sorosfunded people for the american way pfaw explains how to get away with voter fraud 
instead of bussing people in it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles he said 
would they charge each individual of voter fraud or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy which they could prove its one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars if theres a bus involved that changes the dynamic 
its the legality because you can prove conspiracy if theres a bus he said if there are cars its much harder to prove  if theres enough money you have people drive their povs personally owned vehicles or you can have them drive rentals 
foval says its easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret so you use shells use shell companies 
democrats are untouchable he said the question is whether when you get caught by a reporter does that matter because does it turn into an investigation or not in this case this state the answer is no because they dont have any power to do anything 
foval explained in the first video how proclinton super pacs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the dnc presumably a violation of federal law 
i guarandamntee you that the people who run the super pacs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication 
were consultants foval says so were not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts 
he adds 
the thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual dnc and what were doing theres a double blind there so they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it 
the clinton campaign is fully in it veteran leftwing strategist robert creamer confirms on hidden camera hillary knows through the chain of command whats going on 
okeefes group project veritas action fund filed a formal complaint against the clinton campaign with the federal election commission last week 
the complaint states that project veritas 
uncovered a criminal conspiracy where in the words of scott foval the way it works is the hillary for america campaign pays dnc dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group the foval group goes and executes  on the ground this has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules 
the complaint also accuses priorities usa action alliance for retired americans americans united for change and the democratic national committee of accepting prohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures contrary to federal law and regulations 
the first undercover video okeefe released sent shock waves through the political community 
in that video  released oct  we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at republican candidate trumps campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by clintons campaign 
the idea was to foment violent at trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the lefts predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist 
such behavior constitutes terrorism austin bay writes at the observer  
creamer ran what amounts to a domestic us political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the  us presidential electionrigging the election to use the current term  
the election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery that means physical fearterroris a core component of americans united for changes crooked enterprise street thuggery is very lowlevel terrorism but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise hardboy muscle bottles and two by fours are street thuggerys kinetics bottles and baseball bats are not al qaedas high explosivesbut they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties people bleed street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse the worse including lynchings and pogroms if you dont think street thuggery is terror then consider kristalnacht 
and okeefe isnt finished with the hillary clinton campaign yet

Activist Post,2016-10-28T18:20:46.917+03:00,things you need to know about the dakota access pipeline protests,"by tony cartalucci 
myanmars defacto leader aung san suu kyi of the national league for democracy ndl political party has paved her time since coming to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy she has not only illegally declared herself leader of the southeast asian state in contravention of its constitution she has also embarked on an ironfisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with 
during elections earlier this year myanmars constitution prevented suu kyi from holding the nations highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas her status of having been married to a foreign and her childrens dual citizenship instead of adhering to the law her party once in power simply contrived an entirely new post for her state counsellor of myanmar which makes her the defacto leader of myanmar 
canadas the globe and mail in an article titled stéphane dion says aung san suu kyi is the de facto leader of myanmar would note that canadas government recognized this legal sidestepping stating 
dion called suu kyi now myanmars foreign minister the de facto national leader of her country because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody whos not of the country you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state 
suu kyi the internationally recognized democracy advocate is barred from becoming president because her late husband was british as are her two sons the rule was crafted during myanmars decades of military rule which suu kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall 
in essence she is unelected and illegally holding power for a woman whos western backers  particularly in the united states and united kingdom  have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law she and her partys first act upon taking power was trampling both the inhumane humanitarian 
another myth built up around nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi by the west has been her advocacy for human rights her advocacy for human rights however appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned for groups beyond this selfserving political protection and particularly regarding her political opponents she and her ndl are just as eager to jail crush or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been 
in addition to escalating violence targeting the nations rohingyas population several activists online have been sent to jail for insulting the ruling government and westernbacked media fronts and organizations 
myanmars eleven media group emg in its article facebook offender brought to court for insulting suu kyi attempted to distance what suu kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now a simple matter of enforcing the law it would state 
a facebook user named zaw zaw aka nga pha was brought to the north dagon township court on october  to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about state counsellor aung san suu kyi 
he has been charged under section d of the telecommunications law 
hes being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the state counsellor posted on facebook said plaintiff nay myo kyaw a yearold resident of north okkalapa township 
around  people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the network of supporters of the rule of law they shouted you deserved it for insulting a good person 
the article also admits 
the myawady township court sentenced aung win hlaing aka a nyar thar the first man to be prosecuted under the current government for defamatory posts on facebook about president htin kyaw to nine months in jail after he was convicted under section d of the telecommunications law 
aung myint tun aka ko pho htaung a member of the national league for democracy is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter 
another man named yar pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake facebook account under the name of nay myo wai the chairman of peace and diversity party 
hla phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on facebook about the commanderinchief 
emg  ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous militaryled government by reporters without borders  would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of myanmars laws to silence its own critics claiming 
eleven media group emg also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on facebook against the group though emg lodged complaints against film director mike tee who is the owner of a facebook account named than tun zaw and another facebook user named myat maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff the legal process has yet to begin emg lodged the complaints on january  and march  this year 
one would expect such a tidal wave of abuse  as defined by the west in regards to media governance and censorship around the world  to be met with sweeping condemnation from the wests various human rights advocacy organizations including human rights watch amnesty international and a no doubt embarrassed reporters without borders  yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling taking over where accused dictators left off 
the wests champions of democracy rule of law and human rights in myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where suu kyi and her ndl party had claimed the militaryled government left off and despite the overt nature of suu kyis breaches of western standards of democracy and human rights the us is on track to lift all sanctions from myanmar as suu kyi and her government open the nation its people and its resources to exploitation by western corporations 
the overt nature of both the wests and suu kyis hypocrisy illustrates that democracy rule of law and human rights are merely facades behind which the west and its proxies wield their power  hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them and in reality such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could  because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the western governments supporting the current regime in myanmar their fauxnongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime and proxies like suu kyi and her ndl themselves 
international audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the west attempts to overturn other governments in southeast asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric  supporting supposed prodemocracy and prohuman rights advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power

project hemisphere a secretive program developed by att searches trillions of call records in order to analyze cell phone data spying on the activity of private individuals in order to identify who they are speaking with and why as well as gps tracking on the location of each individual connected to the call and it transmits this information to the department of justice doj 
in  project hemisphere was shown in a powerpoint presentation produced by the drug enforcement administration the new york times reported this as a partnership between att and the doj primarily deployed for drugenforcement taskforces all information collected in this program is accessible to the federal agencies authorized by the doj 
att specifically developed and marketed this product for use by the doj who would promise hundreds of millions in funds on behalf of taxpayers using the taxpayers own money to spy on their every move this is an invasion of privacy without a warrant this is a federal spy program by proxy working through corporations 
att promises law enforcement that it will not disclose project hemispheres involvement in active investigations that are made public att is is attempting to lower liability for their customer and limit scrutiny to information transmitted to federal agencies through their network 
while it should not be surprising that your cell phone company is working with bureaucrats to collect incriminating evidence on you there is a staggering number of people who still carelessly use their cell phone as if the information being transmitted through the device will be kept private 
news flash its never been private they have always wanted to use your information as a product to sell to the highest bidder your data is their product and you are paying them to take it from you

American News,2016-11-10T12:26:00.000+02:00,rosie odonnell leaving the country for good shes never coming back,"sean brown americas freedom fighters  
wikileaks has revealed some rather troubling things about hillary clinton and her staffers but perhaps the most disturbing a bizarre is the fact that john podesta is involved with satanic rituals 
no this isnt fiction and im not wearing tin foil on my head an email released by wikileaks reveals podesta was invited to a spirit cooking dinner by performance artist marina abramovic and you can rest assured that its not anything like it sounds 
i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining all my love marina an email dated june   read 
shortly after the emails which was sent to podestas brother tony was forwarded to john with the message are you in nyc thursday july  marina wants you to come to dinner 
now youre probably wondering what all the fuss is about and i seriously cant blame you so lets turn to paul joseph watson from infowars for a little background on what this spirit cooking is really all about 
spirit cooking refers to a sacrament in the religion of thelema which was founded by aleister crowley and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood breast milk urine and sperm are used to create a painting 
according to marina abramovic if the ritual is performed in an art gallery it is merely art but if the ritual is performed privately then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony 
the video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the recipe for the painting which is comprised of the words with a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain 
the ceremony is meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm man and the macrocosm the divine which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in hermeticism as above so below 
below is a video of abramovic conducting the satanic ritual 
how creepy even creepier is the same woman holding a bloody goats head  a representation of the satanist symbol baphomet the podestasspirit cooking dinnerits not what you thinkits blood sperm and breastmilk

Steve Watson,2016-10-29T13:10:16.575+03:00,competing theories on why the fbi reopened the hillary email server investigation,"eight ways to strengthen our democracy beyond voting the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections by chuck collins   chuck collins 
throughout this trying election season weve been told how much is at stake with our vote but the success of any democracy depends on continuing to pay attention long after we cast our ballots 
so lets pledge to strengthen our democracy with a few resolutions to focus our intentions and keep us moving forward over the next four years 
 change your media diet  
way too much ink airtime and mental real estate has been consumed by the horserace reporting on electionsits all about whos winning and losing so unplug from the talk shows that interview pollsters and engage in partisan bickering all day find the commentators and independent media outlets that strengthen our civic life 
 turn off corporate media 
this election has been very profitable for big media corporations but bad for our democracy as cbs chairman les moonves remarked  man who would have expected the ride were all having right now the moneys rolling in and this is fun 
our differences have been compounded by media reports that amplify the loudest and most partisan utterances election coverage this year has encouraged us to view one another as cartoon caricatures not neighbors 
 reject the consumer mentality in elections  
were encouraged to view national elections like consumers buying a car but presidential elections can make most of us feel like spectators not participants election day is a small part of our real democracythink of voting as a tiny fraction of your civic life 
 make your voice heard  
pledge to communicate with your elected officials all year round not just when they want your vote call write email and attend community forums when a politician hears from a dozen constituents with the same concern it matters 
a few resolutions must address our polarized political atmosphere the only way to break through this is by connecting with people we dont always agree with 
for instance the liberal california sociologist arlie hochschild spent five years interviewing conservative tea party activists in louisiana making friends and asking deep questions she urges us all to scale the empathy wall and learn each others stories 
heres a few easy ways to get started 
try a social media fast 
social media is amazing but it mostly serves as an echo chamber to reinforce our existing views its not a substitute for talking to people asking questions and learning why people support certain policies 
 practice the art of civil discourse  
find ways to meet others facetoface to engage in conversations not soapbox speeches and debates look at the  living room conversation  movement that brings people together across political divisions their goal is to encourage authentic respectful conversations to strengthen relationships and advance understanding of the challenges opportunities and solutions before us 
finally other resolutions should focus on changing our polarizing election system 
 eliminate the wealth primary  
long before voters cast their ballots in a primary big money donors have winnowed the field and selected who will stand for election people all across the political spectrum agree that we need fundamental campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of big money including the repeal of citizens united  
 break the twoparty duopoly  
a growing number of voters have declared independence from the two major parties so why do we allow other voices and perspectives to be excluded from presidential debates our democracy would benefit if we had real choices outside the two major parties as they do in most other countries in the world 
the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections and especially after the deeply toxic experience of  we all need to step up to protect our real democracy from those who profit from division

# 1 NWO Hatr,2016-10-29T00:46:02.536+03:00,de blasio administration finds a way to ruin food trucks,"off the grid news  by daniel jennings 
a public school official in florida has urged citizens to fight truancy by reporting any children they suspect might not be in school or being educated  including homeschool families 
it is all part of an antitruancy initiative called operation round up in which residents of jackson county florida are urged to be on the lookout for children not in school and to report them to school officials or to police 
a truancy report can lead to a home check by sheriffs deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents tv station wjhg reported 
the policy of the jackson county school district is to send law enforcement to the homes of suspected truants 
sometimes if these citizens dont call me i have no way of knowing shirl williams director of student services for the school system told the tv station so if its a nosy neighbor be a nosy neighbor just call me and let me check out the situation 
williams acknowledged that homeschool children can be mistaken for truants but urged citizens to report them so school authorities can investigate 
sometimes the community will see them around town and they think hey theyre not being educated sometimes the community is right williams said 
home school legal defense association attorney tj schmidt wrote williams and the jackson county superintendent saying that while truancy is a problem homeschoolers should not be targeted 
your statements suggest that everyone should report children they think arent being educated the letter read in our opinion this is a threatening practice and will instill a spirit of suspicion and hostility against homeschoolers in the community 
schmidt wrote to williams after a parent saw her on tv and complained to hsdla

4 Goals For The Neomasculinity Movement During Trumps First Term,2016-11-16T18:07:48.392+02:00,comment on are you on pace to reach your goals by  goals for the neomasculinity movement during trumps first term,"the election of donald trump is already having an enormous impact on the economy   th  
  sent shockwaves through the us economy and the us financial system since november th the dow has hit a brand new alltime record high  the us dollar has strengthened greatly and bank stocks are way up but not all of the economic news is good news unlike stocks bonds have reacted very negatively to trumps election victory the past week has been an absolute bloodbath for bond traders and as you will see below this is going to have dramatic implications for all us consumers moving forward 
over just a two day period more than a trillion dollars was wiped out as bond yields spiked all over the globe as cnn has noted  this type of violent reaction in the bond market has only happened three other times within the past ten years 
the rate on year treasury notes has surged to  from  before the election last weeks spike in treasury rates was so big that it had only happened three times before in the last decade 
blackrocks russ koesterich called it a violent reaction 
the move stands to have broad repercussions for all americans not only will the us government have to pay more to borrow money but mortgage rates and car loan costs should also rise thats because treasuries are used as the benchmark for many other forms of credit 
as interest rates rise virtually everyone in our society is going to feel the pain 
those that need an auto loan in order to purchase a vehicle are going to find that loan payments are significantly higher than they were before 
credit card rates will also go up and those just getting out of school will discover that their student loan payments are even more suffocating 
but the biggest impact will be felt in the housing market the average rate on a year fixed mortgage just hit the psychologicallyimportant  percent barrier and that could mean big trouble for the housing market in   
the average contract rate on the popular year fixed mortgage hit  percent according to mortgage news daily a level most didnt expect to see until the middle of next year rates have now moved nearly a half a percentage point higher since donald trump was elected president 
the situation on the ground is panicked damage control said matthew graham chief operating officer of mortgage news daily people were trying to lock loans quickly last week and are now facing a tough choice to lock today or hope for a bounce many hoped for a bounce last week heading into the long weekend and we obviously didnt get it 
rising interest rates was one of the key factors that precipitated the financial crisis of  and many fear that it could happen again 
and without a doubt this rise in rates is going to affect the affordability of homes that are already on the market  
if youre going to buy a house and your mortgage payment went up by  or  you may buy a smaller house theres impact on interest rate sensitive sectors like autos and housing and also corporate bonds themselves where financial engineering has helped juice up the equity market said george goncalves head of rate strategy at nomura 
in addition rising rates will make it more difficult for those with adjustable rate mortgages to keep their homes foreclosure activity was already up  percent during the month of october and many are projecting that we could see another giant spike in foreclosures during the months ahead that is similar to what we saw during the last financial crisis 
many trump supporters dont really care what the rest of the world thinks of our new president but this is an area where what the rest of the world thinks really really matters 
the truth is that the rest of the planet is not all too fond of trump and if that makes them a lot less eager to lend us money that is a major problem 
the only way that we can maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is to continue to borrow gigantic mountains of money from the rest of the world at ultralow interest rates 
if the rest of the world starts demanding higher rates of return now that trump is president we are going to experience economic pain on a scale that most americans dont believe is possible 
one of our big lenders has been china and right now they are deeply   a trump presidency might mean trump has talked very tough about trade with china and the chinese are gearing up for a major trade war the following comes from cnbc  
during his election campaign this year trump spoke of a  percent import tariff on all chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work should any such policy come into effect china will take a titfortat approach according to an opinion piece in the global times  a newspaper backed by the communist party 
a batch of boeing orders will be replaced by airbus us auto and iphone sales in china will suffer a setback and us soybean and maize imports will be halted china can also limit the number of chinese students studying in the us the global times article read 
most trump supporters assume that since trump has been a very successful businessman that he will be able to strengthen the us economy 
but it isnt that simple 
the only reason we are able to live the way that we live today is because we have been able to borrow trillions upon trillions of dollars at irrationally low interest rates 
the moment the rest of the world decides that they are not going to loan us money at irrationally low interest rates any longer the game is over and it wont really matter who is in the white house at that point 
so watch interest rates very carefully if they keep going up it is inevitable that a major economic slowdown will follow no matter what economic policies the new trump administration implements november th   tags bank stocks  bond crash  bond traders  bonds  donald trump  economic news  feel the pain  financial  foreclosure  foreclosure activity  foreclosure activity rising  foreclosure help  foreclosures  foreclosures rising  good news  home foreclosures  pain  stocks  the dollar  the dow  the pain  the stock market  the us dollar  the us economy  the us financial system  trump  us consumers  category housing crash  the economy    mleblanc 
crash and burn house prices crash and burn houses go sky high while wages remain stagnant not sustainable time for a correction an excessive correction genada 
to lose weight you have to take some pain eat less work out same goes with making our economy work for americans we are going to need to take some pain to be able to improve the economy and make it work for every american and not just the top 
the rates had to go up they couldnt really go down anymore and its going to have some negative impacts but those impacts are due to living beyond our means and making bad choices now we will need to pay for that a bit 
lack of lending from others will require us to produce at all and thats a good thing producing at home will lead to more jobs and make us less depend on others less 
then the final major truth about the world economy is and you have detailed many times is that the worlds debt is far in excess of what can be payed its time for write downs and admit this then after the pain of that to put things in place to prevent this from happening again retired 
ultimately we have them all by the gonads with the eu sinking into bankruptcy america will be the last major consumer market left standing the american consumer economy is over  of the total economy the exporting nations have no where else to sell their consumer products  raw materialsthey will need to keep the american economy afloat as for the debtit will never be paidit will be rolled over indefinitely alsothere will be financial chaos around the world when america drops the hammer on the outside world most of the big money from outside will be drawn to america for securitysouth florida is already a haven for wealthy venezuelans who had money parked here for hard times in their homelandcalifornia is in a similar situation with offshore chinese wealth most of the world is part of a global financial system based on american dollars as the worlds reserve currencya large part of the world arein effect provinces in an american financial empireamerica is their bankerthey cant extricate themselves from the dollar  america paul anders 
bottom line is one day soon this house of cards is coming downtrump or no trump but if he can drain the swamp and get the political cesspool back on track i think its worth the pain pain is coming sooner or later anyways retired 
the main thing is to get rid of the central bankers  get a leash on the fire economywhich is mostly huge overhead  is sucking the life out of the real productive economy if it takes pain in the correction we will need to handle it if we want to turn the economic corner castiel

well donald trump certainly has cause for celebration today 
despite having a multibilliondollar net worth an international real estate company and a primetime television show donald trumps ambitions were still set higher the one trophy hed spent his entire life trying to claim for his mantle of accomplishments had always evaded himuntil today by winning the  presidential election donald trump is finally able to kick the nations most powerful black family out of their house 
one can only imagine the immense joy donalds wife and children feel for him today 
trump has been preparing for this moment ever since the trump organization first started buying buildings throughout new york city and raising rent for africanamericans until he could toss them out for no longer being able to afford it now after decades of practice and determination the presidentelect will see his magnum opus arrive in the form of booting the incredibly influential and powerful obama family out of the home theyve lived in for the past eight years 
ejecting black people from their residences has been a lifelong passion for donald from practicing discriminatory housing policies that prevented black people from moving into trump buildings to tagging black peoples rental applications with a separate sheet of paper marked c for colored donald has never lost focus on his goal but that was all just warmup for trump who clearly wanted to challenge himself by attempting to evict a wealthy black family of international renown and when he sends president obama michelle malia sasha and all their boxedup belongings packing from their house in january trump will have done just that 
what a truly stunning feat with the biggest item on his bucket list now firmly checked off trump would be more than justified in resting on his laurels to soak in the consummation of all his dreams its hard to imagine an even more powerful and famous black family donald could evict but knowing trump he will continue to push himself whatever his plans are now the world will be watching in anxious anticipation",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3446/9/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,Fake,news election night disaster john king tapped electoral college map hard fell headfirst digital hellscape,email well donald trump certainly cause celebration today despite multibilliondollar net worth international real estate company primetime television show donald trumps ambitions still set higher one trophy hed spent entire life trying claim mantle accomplishments always evaded himuntil today winning presidential election donald trump finally able kick nations powerful black family house one imagine immense joy donalds wife children feel today trump preparing moment ever since trump organization first started buying buildings throughout new york city raising rent africanamericans could toss longer able afford decades practice determination presidentelect see magnum opus arrive form booting incredibly influential powerful obama family home theyve lived past eight years ejecting black people residences lifelong passion donald practicing discriminatory housing policies prevented black people moving trump buildings tagging black peoples rental applications separate sheet paper marked c colored donald never lost focus goal warmup trump clearly wanted challenge attempting evict wealthy black family international renown sends president obama michelle malia sasha boxedup belongings packing house january trump done truly stunning feat biggest item bucket list firmly checked trump would justified resting laurels soak consummation dreams hard imagine even powerful famous black family donald could evict knowing trump continue push whatever plans world watching anxious anticipation,1.0

Larsen Halleck,2016-11-06T20:01:01.964+02:00,dont believe the myth that weightlifting will slow you down,"home this month popular the path men took to trump the path men took to trump 
daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   politics 
every man who supports donald trump came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women  the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center 
in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door 
i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it 
it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around 
fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw  
the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes 
i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them 
though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald trump donald trump ground zero 
im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow trump to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe 
the ground zero for donald trump within the manosphere was the donald trump thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have 
after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald trump the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time 
the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it approaching the date of the election 
two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for trump  and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a trump presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald trump doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency 
obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat trump 
not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment 
for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge trump by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign 
i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink trumps candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully trump responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down 
the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that trumps support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that trump was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug 
from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against trump i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
the most important lesson i learned from trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination 
george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably 
think right now of how much effort the antitrump forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public 
whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing 
now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled 
you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes 
if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness conclusion 
we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes 
im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next nov   roosh valizadeh",english,returnofkings.com,No Image URL,hate,Real,relentless media censorship brining us fate worse big brother,people coming truthful conclusion globalism failure nationalism countrys people interests valued noncitizens way forward problem globalismnationalism framework exactly type dialectic elites use usher global war crackdown increase power imagine wife tired husband going every night friends drink instead nagging every evening would effect motivating leave house even sooner wait gets drunk driving accident serious bar fight could draw line make reasonable ultimatum never drink husband likely listen something wrong takes place safe night right nationalist movement allowed gain strength future event act trigger globalists draw line movement imprisoning killing strongest members words globalists plan use nationalism trap device transform advantage right budding nationalist movement extremely useful allowing identify resisters easily crushing time right elites cannot advance plans without dialectic way elites move agenda forward dialectic meaning two opposing ideologies rub create friction comes desired result ie order chaos power either control monitor existence sides guide bend dialectic serve ends recent rise nationalism speculate allowed previous dialectics capitalism vs communism democracy vs terrorism longer useful advancing desired agenda soviet communism dead increased terrorism allow planned wars syria iran proceed like iraq afghanistan addition white vs black race war years late stubbornly resistant gasoline obama pours onto fire new dialectic must nurtured nationalism may trick hillarys recent alt right speech officially debuted american nationalism new enemy conclusion nationalism logical beneficial nation true im sure agree guided onto beliefs arrive nationalist thought decades free trade feminism opendoor immigration worn country arrival nationalist conclusions direct result globalism means nationalist thoughts exist mind likes george soros pulled million muslims hat placed europe sponsoring multitude social justice organizations united states actions behavior along powerful globalists like essentially created ideology entrenched dialectic opposing forces must exist combat growth nationalism useful nationalism must continue grow power right moment threaten globalist banking geopolitical interests globalists clamp severely replaying world war identify nationalist country big bad bully use country excuse start war simultaneously weed nationalists throughout world sending die arrested home subversion treason russia evil nationalist country neocons others poking even poland puffed undemocratic country order hedge bets hint may already taking place france recently called upon patriots serve national guard protect citizens since france care patriots committed consistent actions past decade suggest care must reasonably conclude new army trap attract nationalists game end result death wouldnt surprised frances beefedup army used start war place like poland painted aggressor caused economic attacks upon saintly western europeans long youre dialectic see sort twilight zone creation mega rich youre fighting terms need nationalist grassroots uprising create violent events allow reassert control power even though nationalism may sane movement day still plays hands long insist two sides debate good evil living hollywoodstyle storyline instead twodimensional arrangement solution may go move front back around spectrum ideas instead left right youre pawn game matter side pick nationalist resistance growing doesnt mean globalists power hurt without able effectively control western population cold war terrorism racial divideandconquer modern russian aggression hoping nationalist movement grows enough create conflict moves chess pieces forward im urging throw away nationalist beliefs surely wont throw away mine clear trap waiting sprung suffer finally launched article originally published roosh v dont miss patriarchal nationalism national identity,0.0

 chimps will betray their own to get their hands on italian food as with all chimps the ones i studied in gombe were absolutely obsessed with italian food and would go to extraordinary lengths to get their hands on some one day the troops alpha male whom i called goliath managed to acquire a plate of linguine humphrey a younger male saw goliaths linguine and became incredibly jealous he offered to give goliath his most prized possessiona vacant hornet nest that he enjoyed having sex within exchange for the linguine but goliath declined as he already had a hornet nest of his own desperate to eat the linguine humphrey threw some pebbles to divert goliaths attention then snuck up behind him and ripped his head off allowing him to take the italian food from his superior it was a gruesome yet utterly fascinating scene 
 when chimpanzee communities encounter a japanese researcher they will try to put them in jail my colleague dr kiyoshi yamamoto discovered this when chimps dragged him from his tent in the middle of the night down to the local prison the apes would then approach the towns sheriff with their hands out expecting a food reward it was truly shocking to learn that chimpanzees are capable of such things nature is not always pretty 
 most chimps can vocalize the phrase oh no they like to yell it while they defecate  chimps dont like it when you blow up one of their family members with a grenade one of my young researchers sofia manfredi discovered this after rolling an active grenade into a ditch where several male siblings were sharing a lunch of termites and soup the grenade exploded the youngest one into a red mist of viscera and bone and curiously the other brothers seemed to become rather disheartened 
 chimps revere hippos when they become aware of a hippo in the vicinity chimps stop whatever theyre doing and take turns honoring the beast they bring offerings of plump salamanders crushed soda cans and other treasures theyve found in the dirt and they join together in an angelic chorus of growls to soothe the hippo new mothers will rub their infants against the hippos groin to bless them with his virility the troops elders will break off their incisors with a rock and fashion a crude crown of teeth for the hippo to wear if the hippo becomes aggressive towards them they do not resist in fact it is an honor for them to be crushed by the hippo and they will often place their heads on the ground next to his hooves in hopes that he might accidentally stomp their skulls flat 
 if a chimp dunks its head into a bucket of horchata for an hour it will die whenever chimps discover a large pail of horchata in the forest the eldest female of the group will approach it and slowly lower her head into the liquid remaining there for an hour or more until another chimp yanks her out of it it was fascinating to observe the way their social structure altered afterwards with the next eldest female unfailingly rising up to lead the groups children in licking the sweet rice milk from their deceased matriarchs body",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3472/7/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,Fake,life finding common ground white man muslim woman trump painted garages,email jane goodall dedicated life studying primates insights gained evolutionary ancestors truly powerful prepare breath taken away dr goodalls words chimps betray get hands italian food chimps ones studied gombe absolutely obsessed italian food would go extraordinary lengths get hands one day troops alpha male called goliath managed acquire plate linguine humphrey younger male saw goliaths linguine became incredibly jealous offered give goliath prized possessiona vacant hornet nest enjoyed sex within exchange linguine goliath declined already hornet nest desperate eat linguine humphrey threw pebbles divert goliaths attention snuck behind ripped head allowing take italian food superior gruesome yet utterly fascinating scene chimpanzee communities encounter japanese researcher try put jail colleague dr kiyoshi yamamoto discovered chimps dragged tent middle night local prison apes would approach towns sheriff hands expecting food reward truly shocking learn chimpanzees capable things nature always pretty chimps vocalize phrase oh like yell defecate chimps dont like blow one family members grenade one young researchers sofia manfredi discovered rolling active grenade ditch several male siblings sharing lunch termites soup grenade exploded youngest one red mist viscera bone curiously brothers seemed become rather disheartened chimps revere hippos become aware hippo vicinity chimps stop whatever theyre take turns honoring beast bring offerings plump salamanders crushed soda cans treasures theyve found dirt join together angelic chorus growls soothe hippo new mothers rub infants hippos groin bless virility troops elders break incisors rock fashion crude crown teeth hippo wear hippo becomes aggressive towards resist fact honor crushed hippo often place heads ground next hooves hopes might accidentally stomp skulls flat chimp dunks head bucket horchata hour die whenever chimps discover large pail horchata forest eldest female group approach slowly lower head liquid remaining hour another chimp yanks fascinating observe way social structure altered afterwards next eldest female unfailingly rising lead groups children licking sweet rice milk deceased matriarchs body,1.0

thats where you come in
the trump administration is now soliciting people to apply for jobs for when the man himself takes office in january we are officially calling on all ready and able return of kings readers to submit their applications and take up any job offers heres why you should consider a job in president trumps administration beyond obvious reasons such as money and prestige
 itll help keep president trump accountable 
while the media is lying about trump reneging on his campaign promises its still a good idea to give the man more reasons to keep his word by staffing his administration with committed nationalists well make it easier for president trump to fulfill his political program as well as make it more difficult for him to go back on his promises remember it was rankandfile fbi agents who forced james comey to reopen the investigation into hillary clinton  a leader needs loyal men in order to carry out his agenda
 youll be able to make history 
given the momentous task of rebuilding america after eight years of obamas perfidy and failure you almost have a civic duty to help president trump in his mission expecting america to become great again all on its own is delusional we need to do our part to restore this nations glory by working with the trump administration youll have a direct role in reshaping america for yearspossibly decadesto come
 youll help trigger the left 
despite their massive losses in the electionbeyond hillary clintons defeat the democrats now control only a handful of state governments and failed to dent the gops congressional majoritythe leftist mainstream media is trying to order trump around and persuade him to staff his administration with the same flacks who filled bushs and obamas right now theyre freaking out over breitbart executive chairman stephen bannon being appointed as trumps chief strategist 
by joining the trump administration youll have a hand in helping trigger the left into conniption fits and spasms of impotence nothing horrifies them more than losing access to the levers of power which theyve controlled for decades watching leftists squirm and cry is one of the biggest fringe benefits of trumps victory and we need to keep the triggering up for years to come
if you think you have the job skills return of kings highly recommends you apply for a job in trumps administration  president trump may have started the fire but its our job to help the fire rise

hillary clinton declared during nbc newss commanderinchief forum that no lives were lost in libya when she made the move to take out dictator muammar gaddafi even so the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that  months later four americans  including us ambassador christopher stevens  were killed in a terrorist attack in benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created 
that was one of the few situations in american foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we dont make the wrong move and the operation was a success even donald trump supported it clinton argued as with any operation of such magnitude we had a few hiccups but it was nothing out of the ordinary as ive said the operation was a success 
she continued so much so in fact that im proud to say that no important people were lost through it all and when i say that i say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that libyans could be freed from the iron fist of gaddafi it would have been unrealistic to expect  casualties however the overall toll did not exceed expectations with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy 
politics can be a cruel line of work that being said i stand before you here today and i am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it and while were on the subject of sacrifices thank god they did not include anyone important from the american delegation including yours truly she said jokingly causing the auditorium to laugh 
she said but all jokes aside i have to pay homage to the cia who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day its agents work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come if it hadnt been for them we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations i am proud that the united states of america has an intelligence agency such as the cia 
im sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay a bargain if you will when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist i would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region for better of worse we acted and i am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the cia out of a deal because in the words of a personal friend of mine who is a former cia spook  shutting down arms dealers is easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part she concluded",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14775662771.jpg,conspiracy,Fake,busted bill recorded telling mistress deny clintons helped get state job,email hillary clinton declared nbc newss commanderinchief forum lives lost libya made move take dictator muammar gaddafi even former secretary state mention fact months later four americans including us ambassador christopher stevens killed terrorist attack benghazi arose instability overthrow created one situations american foreign policy decision making processes everybody came together make sure dont make wrong move operation success even donald trump supported clinton argued operation magnitude hiccups nothing ordinary ive said operation success continued much fact im proud say important people lost say say utmost respect give lives sides libyans could freed iron fist gaddafi would unrealistic expect casualties however overall toll exceed expectations greater amount damage side enemy politics cruel line work said stand today proud say giving democracy people contact generations wonderful thing makes sacrifices worth subject sacrifices thank god include anyone important american delegation including truly said jokingly causing auditorium laugh said jokes aside pay homage cia performed outstandingly saved day agents work field immeasurable contribution asset would wise treasure generations come hadnt would able perform operation cleanly little impact surrounding nations proud united states america intelligence agency cia im sure many among disagree position one embassy small price pay bargain comes ridding world another dictator terrorist would also like remind everyone price would gone immeasurably sat idly allowed gaddafi rage cause death destruction throughout region better worse acted convinced dictator ever think cheating cia deal words personal friend mine former cia spook shutting arms dealers easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads hard part concluded,1.0

the ecoloons protesting the dakota pipeline have the support of the media and the white house but many of the local sioux dont see them as defenders they just wish they would go home  
ask around and youll hear stories of pipeline protesters whove traveled great distances theyve come from japan russia and germany australia israel and serbia and of course there are the allies not exclusively native american or indigenous whove flocked here from all corners of the us 
demonstrating is their proud daily work 
the obnoxious leftists of the world have united and they want no pipelines or showers 
no one makes this clearer than robert fool bear sr  district chairman of cannon ball the town he runs estimated population of  is just a few miles from the action its so close that given the faceoffs with law enforcement you have to pass through a police checkpoint to reach it 
its about time people heard from folks like him he says 
fool bear has had it with the protesters he says that more than two years ago when members of the standing rock sioux tribe could have attended hearings to make their concerns known they didnt care now suddenly the crowds are out of control and he fears its just a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt 
go down to the camps he says and you wont see many standing rock sioux 
it irks me people are here from all over the world he says if they could come from other planets i think they would 
and the sioux are stuck helping leftist idiot protesters 
not long ago he found three teenage girls from ontario canada camped out inside his storage shed a white woman from spokane washington came to see him for help saying shed come here with nothing and her car had broken down when he was at the casino recently someone approached him about two young kids who were on their own because their parents had been arrested 
even though fool bear is against the protests that doesnt mean hes not preparing to help people out too he anticipates opening the community gymnasium for people without beds come winter and a growing pile of sleeping bags and blankets sits in his office 
those protesters from arizona georgia and california wont know what hit them when the cold rushes in he says

Robert Spencer,2016-10-28T07:55:00.267+03:00,the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists,"originally published by the jerusalem post  
in one of the immortal lines of godfather   mafia boss michael corleone discusses the fate of his brother who betrayed him with his enforcer i dont want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive corleone said 
message received the brother was murdered after their mothers funeral last week it was reported that the obama administration has delivered a message to the palestinian authority the administration has warned the pa that the us will veto any antiisrael resolution brought before the un security council before the us presidential elections on november  message received open season on israel at the security council will commence november  the palestinians are planning appropriately israel needs to plan too israels most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank president barack obama in his final eight weeks in power lobbying the administration is pointless obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on israel for not supporting his hostile strategically irrational policies and he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones before turning to what israel must do first we need to understand what israel can do a good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at unesco where twice in a week unesco bodies resolved to erase  years of jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount the fight that israel waged at unesco is not the fight it needs to wage at the security council the stakes at the security council are far higher like the un general assembly unescos decisions are nonbinding declarations that have no legal or operational significance as such there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them for israel the goal of the fight at unesco is not to defeat antiisrael initiatives that is impossible given the palestinians automatic majority the purpose of the fight at unesco is to humiliate european governments that side with antisemitic initiatives and to weaken the congenitally antiisrael body itself the government achieved both of these objectives italian prime minister matteo renzis disavowal of his own governments abstention from the vote on the first resolution  like the similar position taken after the fact by the mexican government  was a diplomatic victory for israel so too the fact that unescos own secretarygeneral irina bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agencys actions by rejecting the resolutions denial of the jewish peoples ties to jerusalem was a significant victory for israel her statement was deeply damaging for unesco and its reputation finally the fact that tanzania and the philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to israels capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional propalestinian voting pattern the palestinians won the vote at unesco because they are more powerful diplomatically than israel they have an automatic antiisrael majority but they werent empowered by their victory to the contrary they were bloodied by it in a sign of their weakening hold on member nations the palestinians and jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of unescos world heritage committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution powerful players dont make threats they dont need to israels experience at unesco teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers israel doesnt need to hide in americas shadow it is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the palestinians automatic majority and it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a usbacked assault at the security council unlike unesco the security council can pass legally binding resolutions israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it obamas intention to abandon israel at the security council means that israel comes to this battle severely hobbled but there is one advantage to the uss betrayal over the years israels ability to trust the us to veto antiisrael resolutions at the security council was been a mixed blessing on the one hand the us has secured israel from diplomatic assaults but on the other hand our ability to trust washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective safe in washingtons shadow we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy that is we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys but public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool the syrian regime for instance has no moral case for securing international support bashar assad didnt convince russian president vladimir putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes he bought putins support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in syria then there is morocco another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make last march un secretarygeneral ban kimoon outraged rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that western sahara which morocco occupies is occupied territory morocco quickly secured the support of spain and france and launched an allout onslaught against ban how did morocco manage moroccos most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from north africa to europe anytime it wishes rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut and the french and spanish know it in less than a month ban issued repeated abject apologies game set match morocco from reports to date it appears that shortly after the us elections on november  the malaysians or egyptians will submit a palestinianbacked resolution that defines israeli communities in united jerusalem judea and samaria as illegal if the resolution is brought to a vote the us will fail to veto it such a resolution or a resolution obligating israel to withdraw to the  armistice lines would cause israel grave harm so what resources does israel have to prevent this from happening of course we have public diplomacy and that might work with some friendly nations but it wont get us over the top we need to learn from the syrian and moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer security council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us one such resource is the us congress israels allies in congress are sickened by the obama administrations devastating middle east policies a solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce israels position israel has other resources as well that we can trade on we have natural gas and we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the  century there is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support as for the palestinians as the unesco vote showed they are less popular now than at any time in the past  years all they have to offer is threats and antisemitism both are powerful weapons but they are no longer invincible israels goal must be to use our resources at the security council in a manner that will make it impossible for obama to enable an antiisrael resolution to pass a method for achieving this goal has two components the first component is to convince a friendly country on the security council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the palestinianbacked israelbashing one such a resolution could include four points first it could deplore efforts to deny jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount second it can condemn the paplo for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists third it can urge israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future palestinian state fourth it can call on israel and the pa to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions israel has friendly ties with a few security council members among them uruguay and new zealand in the final weeks of the obama era it is possible that israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines obama would be hardpressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles israel out for rebuke but that still is insufficient obama can make uruguay and new zealand a better offer if he wishes and so we move to the second aspect of the plan if we learn nothing else from the obama era we must recognize that the time has come for israel to stop sufficing with just one security council veto most states have several and we need a few more russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto putin is a dealmaker as his agreement with assad showed he is willing to consider attractive offers obviously israel wont offer russia bases but we do have other things to offer putin in exchange for a veto for instance in exchange for a russian veto at the security council israel can offer putin to lobby the us congress to cancel us sanctions against russia over russias annexation of crimea israel has no dog in that fight and the sanctions are not getting the us anywhere putin might go for the deal for two reasons first by stepping into the breach and defending israel against obama he will humiliate obama second if israel succeeds with the congress he will reap economic rewards for his part putin wouldnt even have to openly side with israel all he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on israel and the palestinians if putin supports a balanced resolution obama will be checkmated his plan to take revenge on israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled israel will have survived his presidency none of this will be easy and success is far from assured there are many more ways for israel to fail than succeed our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck but as the unesco resolutions showed attacking israel is no longer cost free we are not powerless in the grip of circumstances we have cards to play and now is the time to play them for all they are worth",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/lp_1.jpg?itok=3ClxpnGN,hate,Real,battle unesco,feminists learn melania trump

the march   correspondence was posted by wikileaks after the email was ostensibly captured in john podestas hacked gmail account 
the message was a response to a suggestion from clintons communications director jennifer palmieri that clinton make a joke about the email fiasco during a charity dinner later that day this was two months before the state department publicly released the first batch of clintons emails messages which had previously been provided to the house select committee on benghazi

im not hard over either way but i would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke because email retention  benghazi

as a woman who rejects thirdwave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis ive had my fair share of feminists tell me that i only reject them and their ideas because i suffer from internalized misogyny or in other words im a selfloathing sexist 
heres exactly how everyday feminism defines internalized misogyny if youre unfamiliar with bats crazy 
internalized misogyny by definition is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women 
it becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate overtly and covertly that women are less than men  less worthy less strong less dependable less able less of a leader less logical  while also more than men more emotional more irrational more complex more to manage 
of course this is ridiculous and i gave such an assertion about as much time as a i would a male feminist hitting on me zero seconds 
but on wednesday i learned that team hillary the political left likewise thought me a selfloathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for queen pantsuit because i couldnt stomach the thought of a powerful woman since i apparently believe women are lessers in fact ia woman with a chronic case of internalized misogynycost hillary the election not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag it was my fault clinton campaign communications director jess_mc on election loss internalized misogyny is a real thing inners httpstcorvtuih  all in wchris hayes allinwithchris november

you are the feminists who tell me that theres a special place in hell for me if i dont cast my ballot for crooked hillary like all of a sudden feminists believe in god and an afterlife lol 
you are the feminists who tell me im super mean and shame women when i point out that bragging about murdering unborn babies is gross and despicable by the way it is gross and despicable  
you are the feminists who demonize men with thinkpieces on how and why we should banish socalled  toxic masculinity  from this world 
you are the feminists who shut men up because of their gender while simultaneously telling me gender is a social construct and no i will not cater to your preferred pronouns you entitled brat protip once the number of genders youve madeup passes the number of flavors at baskin robbins its time to admit you have a problem 
you are the social justice warriors who tell me im a hateful selfish capitalistic pig from your iphone at your local safe space equipped with coloring books bubbles and puppies across from the starbucks you work weekends at 
you are the social justice warriors who viciously riot when you dont get your way meanwhile youre not even registered to vote  
you are the social justice warriors shoutingdown any free speech which doesnt perfectly align with your ideology ironically in the name of tolerance and inclusiveness 
you are the virtuesignaling celebrities who think i give a hoot about your political stance please go ahead and move to canada no one will miss you i certainly wont 
you are the mainstream media so desperate for your leftist narrative that youll lie to the american people to advance it so hellbent on painting middleamerica and republicans as racist youll frame actual policy discussions into a segment of whos the biggest xenophobe republican edition 
you are the leftist telling me im a racist for not supporting the divisive hate group black lives matter first of all its mostly comprised of a bunch of loser white kids second of all call me crazy but once you start calling for and actually assassinating police officers  im out i know how racist of me

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-27T21:12:14.598+03:00,obama votes against us at un,"an eyebrowraising new study from a nonpartisan research institute october   matthew vadum 
the obama administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical leftwing activist groups that work to elect democrats according to an eyeopening new study from a nonpartisan research institute 
during eric holders term as attorney general from february  through april  a little under  billion was paid by us banks under the threat of federal lawsuits all but  million of that sum came from three big settlements bank of america citigroup and jp morgan chase 
many of the cases rest on bogus disparate impact theory which leftwing government lawyers use to make sure that banks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income areas regardless of the reasons for the disparity 
instead of being used to help the supposed victims of these banks the money flows to leftist allies of president obama 
adding insult to injury the process by which the money snakes its way to leftwing organizations is both corrupt and unconstitutional according to the report from the government accountability institute that is called follow the money how the department of justice funds progressive activists bestselling clinton cash author and anticorruption crusader peter schweizer is gais president the full page report is available in pdf form here  
the report states 
the department of justice has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to thirdparty organizations outside of the appropriations processan unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for congressional authority 
it adds these funds directed by the doj effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by congress 
much of the cash moves through neighborworks the nonprofit gave more than  million to the rabblerousing group neighborhood assistance corp of america naca whose leader bruce marks calls himself a bank terrorist it also gave over  million to asian americans for equality aafe an organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal north korean sympathizer 
the illgotten funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to leftwing groups such as national council of la raza nhs of chicago national urban league and operation hope 
many of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect democrats 
catalist a george sorosfunded forprofit data analytics company specializing in leftprogressive causes along with a group called nonprofit vote mobilize these federally funded nonprofits  to get the vote out for those who tend to be reliably progressive the report states 
catalist was founded by former bill clinton aide harold ickes in  following democrats electoral wipeout in  leftwing activists believed republicans owed george w bushs reelection victory to heavy spending on voter contact technology including databases 
according to a capital research center report  
catalist boasts it was vital to president obamas  victory by its own admission over  organizations campaigns and committees used the companys services based on data that was loaded into the catalist databases and then standardized a catalist analysis of the  cycle says progressive organizations the obama campaign and federal party committees attempted to contact more than  million people this means that the progressive community attempted to contact over  of the us adult population contacts were delivered inperson over the phone by mail and over the internet 
of course leeching off others is generally how the activist left funds itself apart from oceans of cash supplied by leftwing fatcat megadonors like george soros and michael bloomberg and a galaxy of radical foundations the left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the federal state and local levels 
the report states the evidence shows the left is using the department of justice and the power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist 
in other words the left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of america there is no level socalled playing field in american electoral politics in a sense the system is rigged there is the parasitic left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else 
conservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail for a half century the left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance radical subversive causes in the united states 
changes in federal social policy in the mids helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist astroturfing under the profoundly antisocial war on poverty the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since  to liberal and radical socalled community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo one could say america declared war on itself and conscripted saul alinskyinspired pressure groups to do the fighting in recent decades those on the left  including groups like acorn and moneygrubbing con artists like jesse jackson sr  have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests 
conservative groups receive no such largesse from uncle sam and in fairness many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered it 
this sueandsettle corruption will undoubtedly continue if hillary clinton becomes president secretary of labor tom perez  no stranger to the shakedown business himself is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new clinton administration perez who previously ran the dojs civil rights division is also a past president of casa de maryland a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by george soros and the late venezuelan strongman hugo chavez 
the moneyraising scam described in the gai report isnt the only way leftwing groups fill up their bank accounts 
activist groups were encouraged to agitate by the carterera community reinvestment act which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like acorn had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in socalled underserved communities banks that paid enough  whatever that means  got left alone but banks that didnt got their legs broken 
few serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of  were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination 
leftists played both sides they called banks racist and demanded more subprime lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers it was and is pure gangsterism through the magic of dysphemism the once sought after subprime lending was transformed into predatory lending 
the shaking down of lenders intensified when thentreasury secretary robert rubin presided over the clinton administrations effort to put the cra on steroids banks began to make risky subprime loans and fannie mae and freddie mac aggregated them for sale in the secondary market as mortgagebacked securities these practices made it easier for banks to give in to the demands of acorn and other groups to originate more and more doomed mortgages because they knew they could offload their highrisk debt on quasigovernmental suckers fannie and freddie which were under intense political pressure to service the subprime market 
president clinton turned the community reinvestment act a onceobscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law into one of the most powerful mandates shaping american citiesand as senate banking committee chairman phil gramm memorably put it a vast extortion scheme against the nations banks howard husock of the manhattan institute wrote in city journal  
when husock wrote in  us banks had committed nearly  trillion for innercity and lowincome mortgages and real estate development projects most of it funneled through a nationwide network of leftwing community groups intent in some cases on teaching their lowincome clients that the financial system is their enemy and implicitly that government rather than their own striving is the key to their wellbeing 
enterprising leftwing levelers never tire of dreaming up these redistribution schemes 
and they never will",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/hans-looking-die-hard-hans-gruber-18648743-1280-720.jpg?itok=O3M-HMzn,hate,Real,left

Joe from MassPrivateI,2016-10-28T16:08:48.284+03:00,patriot act at  do you feel safer,"cbc news 
a large map with the slogan pray for the redoubt hangs behind the till at warren campbells army surplus store located just outside coeur dalene idaho 
campbell moved his family from california about a year and a half ago in part because he believes the us economy is on the verge of collapse but also to get more god and less government in his life and to live around likeminded people 
the american redoubt is a stronghold its the last bastion for god country liberty constitution second amendment and home schooling he said warren campbell inside his army surplus store redoubt surplus and tactical near coeur dalene idaho erin collinscbc 
a redoubt is a littleused military term that refers to a temporary fortification the american redoubt is both a movement and an unofficial geographic zone that includes idaho wyoming montana and the eastern parts of washington and oregon 
the term was coined in  by survivalist james wesley rawles who identified the region as the best place to wait out a disaster in the us be it natural economic or political 
rawles sees the redoubt as a place where mostly conservative christian americans who are worried about the future should move and prepare for the worst the goal is to create a safe haven where likeminded americans many of whom refer to themselves as preppers can live off the land be more selfsufficient and wait out the calamities to come the holy cause of liberty 
past the tactical gear and through a hallway at the back of redoubt surplus and tactical  youll find pastor warren campbells other venture the lordship church  
adorned in military garb and sporting an abe lincolnstyle beard campbell sets out folding metal chairs to get ready for his weekend service where about three dozen people usually come to hear him preach 
we love to preach on liberty the holy cause of liberty  george washington called liberty a sacred fire and our liberties are very very dear to us especially the liberties we have in jesus christ pastor warren campbell inside his makeshift church connected to his army surplus store in northern idaho erin collinscbc 
campbell says hes met dozens of people who have recently moved to the area mostly from california and colorado because theyre frustrated with what they feel is government overreach including rising taxes stiffer gun regulations and the affordable care act or obamacare 
he says hell likely vote for republican presidential candidate donald trump on nov  primarily because he believes a hillary clinton administration would erode religious freedoms and the right to bear arms 
and despite the polls campbell believes trump will win if he doesnt he expects the redoubt will get a lot more crowded 
i think we will see a great influx of people more than we are seeing right now multiplying by thousands coming here for safety and refuge 
with all the mudslinging and scandal that has defined this us presidential campaign perhaps it shouldnt be surprising theres talk of political migration 
once again this election cycle some democrats including several celebrities  have threatened to move to canada should their candidate lose 
folks in the redoubt suspect plenty of trump supporters will consider a move of their own if their candidate loses although not quite as far north people want to feel safe 
a short drive away customers peruse the display cases at ed santoss busy post falls gun shop and shooting range theyre served by staff wearing side arms who show off everything from handguns to automatic weapons 
the american redoubt is a stronghold its the last bastion for god country liberty constitution second amendment and home schooling  warren campbell owner of redoubt surplus and tactical 
santos says many of the people coming through his shop these days are new arrivals looking for a fresh start and a quieter more peaceful life 
many of the things that attracted my wife and i to this area are the same things that are attracting people today  people want to live in a place that feels like a community people want to feel safe when they go out at night 
santos a former army officer cop and minor pro hockey referee says the facility is signing up new members every day and many of them the vast majority of them in fact are from out of this area ed santos fires a pistol inside the gun range attached to his port falls idaho gun shop 
more than  kilometres east that search for safety and community drew chuck leveque and his wife to a wooded property in the isolated foothills of flathead county mont 
the former las vegas vice cop says his biggest worry is that terrorists could knock out americas electrical grid 
leveque opens the creaky doors of a large shipping container in his yard to show how hes prepared for the threat 
this is our fuel storage container and we have a tank with  gallons of diesel and a tank with  gallons of nonethanol regular gasoline 
the fuel will run leveques generator in the event of a prolonged power outage he says hes stored enough food and water for him and his wife to survive for up to four years 
but leveque believes he will also need to protect what hes stored from those who are less prepared so like many people here in the redoubt he has stockpiled weapons and ammunition too chuck leveque opens up the sea lift container that holds two tanks of fuel to run his generator in case the power grid goes down erin collinscbc 
the us and montana in particular is a gun culture and in the event of a large catastrophe we would need the guns to defend ourselves against people who would want to take our property and our preparedness stores 
in the meantime he worries the countrys political and economic power is waning saddled with too much debt and a political system that has ground to a halt 
its a problem he expects will get worse after the presidential campaign 
no matter which way the election turns out there is going to be a lot of angst by either side canning bullion and bullets 
inside a nondescript industrial mall near kalispell mont dj lebaron puts the finishing touches on a can of dehydrated eggs inside his store big sky preppers  
lebaron who is originally from southern alberta provides survival products and training including how to can everything from gold bullion to bullets 
you want to pack them tight so that they dont sound like bullets if somebody shakes it he said 
for lebaron life in the redoubt is about hoping for the best and preparing for the worst its a mantra he adopted while working with fema americas disaster management agency during the earthquake that rocked the san francisco bay area in  
when bad things happen people that you have called your friends for years are no longer your friends he said when people are cold tired and hungry they forget all about friendships 
his biggest worry is that a natural disaster like an earthquake or flood will disrupt normal life in america but he says the growing uncertainty about americas political and economic future is a close second 
he says trump presents conservatives in the redoubt with a difficult choice this election 
people if they are voting are going to be voting for trump but people dont want trump because nobody can control him and they are worried about what he will do so i guess i will call that a manmade disaster 
he expects the divisions this presidential campaign has reinforced across the country will remain long after the election and will feed some americans desire to retreat to the redoubt

iran says its exports of handwoven carpets to the united states have reached around  million since the removal of sanctions in january 
hamid kargar head of the iran national carpet center told reuters that iran was under pressure in the us market by rivals such as like india pakistan and turkey during the years that the sanctions were in place 
kargar emphasized that the worlds largest buyer imported more than  million worth from iran in  before the trade embargo on the country was tightened 
he emphasized that a growth in exports of handwoven carpets will have a positive impact on the lives of the carpet weavers in the country 
there are almost  million carpet weavers in iran  of whom are working fulltime kargar said 
between march and september this year iran exported  million worth of handmade carpets or  tons to  countries reuters said that was a  percent increase in value and  percent rise in weight compared to a year earlier 
during the sanctions years iran partially compensated for its loss of market share in the united states and europe by finding new buyers in russia china south africa and some latin american countries the report added it still holds about  percent of the global trade in handmade carpets kargar further told reuters

Roosh Valizadeh,2016-11-17T00:00:00.000+02:00,how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe,"why is obama threatening russia with world war  right before the election   october th  
it sure seems like an odd time to be provoking a war with russia as i write this we stand just a little bit more than three weeks away from one of the most pivotal elections in us history and barack obama has chosen this moment to strongly threaten the russians as i wrote about on friday  reuters is reporting that obama is contemplating direct us military action against syrian military targets and the russians have already indicated that any assault on syrian forces would be considered an attack on themselves the rapidly deteriorating crisis in syria has already caused tensions with russia to rise to the highest level since the end of the cold war but now obama is adding fuel to the fire by publicly considering an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia apparently obama believes that russian hackers are interfering in the election and so he wants payback the following comes from an nbc news article entitled  cia prepping for possible cyber strike against russia  
the obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia in retaliation for alleged russian interference in the american presidential election  us intelligence officials told nbc news 
current and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the cia has been asked to deliver options to the white house for a wideranging clandestine cyber operation designed to harass and embarrass the kremlin leadership 
the sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the cia was considering but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation  
somebody should tell obama that he is not playing a video game a cyber attack is considered to be an act of war and the russians would inevitably retaliate and considering how exceedingly vulnerable our cyber infrastructure is i dont know if that is something that we want to invite 
at the end of last week vice president joe biden also publicly threatened the russians  
on friday vice president joe biden met meet the press host chuck todd for an interview that has raised serious concern in russia 
without bothering to question the authenticity of the claims todd took the allegations of russian hacking at face value opening his interview with a loaded question why havent we sent a message yet to putin 
after a moment of stunned silence biden responded were sending a message we have the capacity to do it and it will be at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact 
when todd asked if the public will know a message was sent biden replied hope not 
the russians firmly deny that they had any involvement in the hacking and so far the obama administration has not publicly produced any firm evidence that the russians were behind it 
perhaps the obama administration privately has some evidence but at this point they have not shown that evidence to the american public 
so for joe biden to be making these sorts of threats is a very dangerous thing the russians are taking these threats very seriously and they are preparing to protect their interests  
the threats directed against moscow and our states leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the us vice president 
to the backdrop of this aggressive unpredictable line we must take measures to protect our interests to hedge risks a kremlin spokesman said according to ria novosti news agency 
here in the united states most people dont even realize that we could be on the verge of a major conflict with russia 
but over in russia things are completely different talk of war is everywhere and the potential for war is the number one topic in the russian media right now just check out some of the recent russian media headlines about the conflict between our two nations 
 in contrast to clinton trump has no appetite for war with russia  
and one russian television network recently instructed their viewers to locate the nearest bomb shelter in case a nuclear war between the united states and russia suddenly erupts 
a terrifying russian television broadcast explicitly told civilians to find out where their nearest bomb shelter is and repeatedly asked viewers if they were ready for nuclear war 
one apocalyptic broadcast told viewers on moscows stateowned tv channel ntv if it should one day happen every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is its best to find out now 
i dont believe that the russians are crazy to be thinking that a war might be coming 
to me it almost seems as though obama wants one 
could it be possible that a conflict with russia will be used to alter change or influence the upcoming election in november 
the truth is that it isnt going to take much for the shooting to begin if obama orders airstrikes against syrian forces the russians have said that they will shoot back  
ash carter has threatened russia with consequences after blowing up the ceasefire the pentagon  supported by the joint chiefs of staff  now is peddling potential strikes on syrias air force to punish the regime for what the pentagon actually did blow up the ceasefire one cant make this stuff up 
majorgeneral igor konashenkov russias defense ministry spokesman sent a swift message to our colleagues in washington think twice if you believe you can get away with launching a shadow hot war against russia russia will target any stealthunidentified aircraft attacking syrian government targets  and they will be shot down 
the only serious question then is whether an out of control pentagon will force the russian air force  false flag and otherwise  to knock out us air force fighter jets and whether moscow has the fire power to take out each and every one of them 
i discussed the potential for war with russia in my latest video  hopefully cooler heads will prevail and war with russia will be put off 
but without a doubt the crisis in syria is not going to be resolved any time soon because it is one giant mess most people dont realize that the syrian civil war has essentially been a proxy war between sunni islam and shia islam from the very beginning jihadist rebels that are being armed and funded by saudi arabia and turkey are fighting hezbollah troops that are being armed and funded by iran and now turkish forces have invaded northern syria and this threatens to cause a fullblown war to erupt between turkey and the syrian kurds of course isis is right in the middle of everything causing havoc blowing stuff up and beheading anyone that doesnt believe in their radical version of sunni islam 
it is absolutely insane that the united states and russia could potentially go to war because of this conflict both sides are determined to show the other how tough they are and one false move could set off a spiral of events from which they may be no recovery 
the american people very foolishly elected barack obama twice but up until now the consequences have not been quite as dire as many had been projecting 
however right here at the end of his second term obama is facing a moment of truth if he ends up dragging us into a war with russia the american people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the white house drowning in debt  percent of all americans have debt that is at least  days past due  guest 
if he obama ends up dragging us into a war with russia the american people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the white house 
oh i doubt it most americans just lap up the propaganda fed to them by the mainstream media that has incessantly demonized putin and other foreign leaders where is the outrage over what this administration has done in destabilizing libya and other sovereign nations in the middle east where is the outrage over what the bush administration did in iraq and afghanistan 
there is a video on youtube with general wesley clark discussing how the pentagon planned to attack  countries in  years google it jc teecher 
the reality of the general public putting an atheisticmuzzy into the white house will not strike home until their sons and daughters are coming home in body bags guest 
no when their sons and daughters come back in body bags their parents will wave that american flag and say that their children died to defend the freedoms of this country good grief jc teecher

nothing liked a lame duck traitor to recklessly stick his nose in the affairs of others and then leave office in a few months 
this traitor should have been impeached after one year of his first termbut the american sheeple demanded the change you could believe in so the way i see it we are bearing the fruits of allowing a traitor to occupy the white house and a apethetic population that is not united and sat back and did nothing to protest if hitlery gets in she will gladly continued the change that obama global elite masters has been determined to accomplish and will transform this nation into a nation unrecognizable to most who call this nation home

an interesting thought and one that appears to be supported in some quarters however who purged the military leaders over the past  years and placed those who are now in charge where they are the man seems to be a master at creating situations where a defense ofplausible deniability can be invoked there is little doubt much of what he has done has been a well thought out and implemented strategy that creates a lot of confusion and allows no one to be held accountable look at the irs scandals and the gun running to drug dealers in mexico by the doj everything he does is meant to destabilize society mike smithy

for what it is worth would it not be an easy task for the odramaliberalindustrial war machine to pull off a strike of instant war of immediate reaction with the powers of the iranianrussian regimes in light of a donald trump win next month 
easily it could be the catalyst for a chaotic event of stock market crashes and world wide chaos to invoke a martial law edict which would prevent trump from becoming potus and keep the nwo wheels turning

i am a christian  were not praying for death to anyone however wwlll is inevitable whether we want it to or not its coming its in the bible we must be wise  be ready to meet the lord i just pray that when it does its swift so no one suffers but the enemy is at play  certainly wants it aldownunder

when you compare the candidates i wonder if youve noticed

 hasnt killed anyone  hasnt lied under oath  hasnt committed perjury in congress  hasnt leaked national secrets  hasnt sold uranium to russia  hasnt supplied weapons to militant muslims  hasnt stolen money from the state department  hasnt peddled national interest in turn for donations  hasnt left any americans for dead hasnt provided new toyota trucks to isis 
 hasnt left a string of body bags behind him including two young boys the list goes on and on but i dont have that kind of time 
locker room banter versus treason  there is no comparison 
first any guy who says that they have never participated in locker room banter or said something sexually explicit when they had a reasonable expectation of privacy is either jesus or a liar there is no comparison between natural male human behavior and treasonous activities 
additionally this lowlife ploy by the progressive liberal democrats is disgusting and changes nothing for many of us jfk was having an ongoing affair with marilyn monroe and im sure his secret service agents could have repeated some rather spicy language in which he described their sexual sessions but you know what neither jfks secret service agents nor the mainstream media said anything about the affair much less jfks private conversations about it because they had dignity respect for the office of potus and respect for jfk any one of those things alone should be enough to keep despicable actions of the democrats and the mainstream media from happening around the whole institution of the potus including the potential potus candidates however we see that neither the democrats nor the mainstream media have any honor truth or journalistic integrity remaining 
general george s patton and prime minister winston churchill were both as crude as they come in private and often in public but they got the job done when they were called upon maybe you dont consider donald trump in the same ranks as the above three men maybe you dont think donald trump can get the job done either way i couldnt care less what i do care about is the poor state of our country the damage that barack obama  the democrats have done and the damage that hillary clinton is sure to do for petes sake look at the shell of a city that used to be detroit mi look at chicago with doubledigit murders just about every week if you want the us to look like these longtime democratrun cities by all means vote for hillary clinton if not then the only other viable option is donald trump 
if the worst thing that the democrats the mainstream media and the progressive liberal useful idiots have on donald trump is locker room banter by a man acting like men do then thats nothing to see in my opinion it might actually be beneficial to our country to have an alphamale as potus for a change lynn bowling cosentino

coming this weekend over  million pilgrims will rally in the holy city of karbala to mark the greatest pilgrimage of all  arbaeen right at the heart of iraq surrounded by the terror of the black flag army it is communities of men which will gather in prayers and in mourning to perform the last rites of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the prophet muhammad
while arbaeen has eclipsed even the hajj in terms of attendance few  even within islam have ever heard of the pilgrimage let alone the tragedy it recalls never mind the principles it saw enacted
arbaeen it needs to be said stands very much an offense to wahhabism  this dogma the house of saud has furiously promoted to assert its ascent to power arbaeen it needs to be emphasised actually speaks of this eternal struggle in between good and evil freedom and slavery piety and dogmatism
 sidelined by mainstream media for it speaks of islams attachment and commitment to such values as justice freedom and compassion towards all men and all fashion of faiths arbaeen has nevertheless towered a beacon of hope amid the furious rise of radicalism arbaeen i would personally argue has become a grand symbol of resistance against oppression  the coming together of communities beyond their differences and most importantly perhaps in spite of their differences so that together they could oppose tyranny and offer the oppressed a rampart behind which to find refuge
for those of you who still have no idea what in the world i am talking about allow me to tell you the story of a man  a man whose courage resolute strength of character and yearning for truth have echoed across the centuries to inspire generations upon generations to think themselves free and to rise themselves independent from the yoke of tyranny
more messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally imam hussain ibn alis martyrdom in the plain of karbala over a millennium ago stands testimony to our collective struggle against injustice and though it is islams banner the third imam carried his message was a universal call for freedom  an immovable promise that real tragedy lies not in our failure to defeat tyrants but in our reluctance to oppose them
allow me to take you back a few centuries back when islams early history was still being written back when the name of the prophet muhammad was still murmured in the present tense through the lips of his progeny the house ahlulbayt
only a few decades after islams last prophets passed islam stood divided as a nationstate its religious sovereignty challenged by men of greed and oppression yazid ibn muawiyah was one of them  arguably the most barbaric of them all since he envisioned slaughter to be the legacy of his throne
as bigots brandished islam to rationalise their heresy and proclaim righteous exceptionalism before the abomination of their deeds imam hussain had no other choice but to march against yazid  even if alone for as long as there was breath in him it is justice he would command for all people
and so the imam marched on  from the holy city of mecca to the thendeserted plain of karbala he walked knowing death would be his fate and still he pushed on 
it is this determination to meet evil and not relent in the task which arbaeen speaks of most loudly it is allegiance loyalty and love pilgrims manifest into reality as they walk towards their imam united not faith but in their humanity
arbaeen you most likely were never told is not exclusive to islam arbaeen is neither shia nor sunni arbaeen is for all who dare think themselves free under god and in him seek refuge
and while arbaeen has long been associated to shia islam for its school of thought revolve around those very principles imam hussain consecrated with his death the pilgrimage stands not in opposition or rejection of any faith  quite the contrary since christians yezidis hussainis brahims alongside countless other religious denominations have year after year centuries after centuries come to karbala to remember
arbaeen is remembrance of hussain ibn ali remembrance of the word of god made complete through hussain the man the prophet muhammad called his son and whose leadership he commanded all believers to forever follow
if many failed in their allegiance for fear rendered them motionless before their imams calls hussains station in karbala has echoed ever since of a love so brilliant and unparalleled that all people all nations all faiths across time and space have found themselves compelled to walk the great walk of arbaeen  and through hussain ibn ali find their humanity
arbaeen i have to say speaks to the best of our humanity it is home after all to the best of humanity  martyr among all martyrs there has never been a day like hussains day  and though his name wahhabism has worked to bury under the rubbles of history karbala has remembered its imam with fierce loyalty
a city build around and for hussain ibn ali karbala is a declaration of allegiance to the house of the prophet  those extraordinary men and women whose hearts lips and prayers have spoken islam in wisdom and piety and without whom we would be orphans
every year without fail karbala has fervently commemorated its imam  even in oppression especially when in oppression
before the poison of radicalism karbala has offered generosity and compassion before brutal repression karbala has opened its doors and to all oppressed offered a shelter before the depravity of sectarianism karbalas pulpits have called upon men and women to hold to rope of allah never to disunite
a city surrounded by the evil of daesh karbala has never shun brighter
in the face of insane fanaticism imam hussains followers have never been braver
and so coming this november   karbala will let out a roar which will shook tyrants thrones karbala will offer all of its prayers and all of its devotion  hussains name will be etched on believers hearts tears of allegiance will flow fists will rise to the sky a promise that when called upon all will answer
islam today is best manifested in karbala since karbala shuns no one karbala today has put saudi arabia to shame since it has provided food and shelter to tens of millions of pilgrims  without expectation without any hope of a thank you
a city has proven more generous and compassionate in its destitution than saudi arabia in its wealth and might where the socalled custodians of islam have cried the weight of the hajj on their coffers karbala has provided beyond the mathematically feasible
in a few short days karbala will stop time once more  so that all could remember all martyrs are in fact alive and that the sons of hussain are still standing vigil",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Protest_against_Donald_Trump_2_22585.jpg,bs,Fake,title,shares coming weekend million pilgrims rally holy city karbala mark greatest

SUPREMEMASTER,2016-10-26T17:15:00.000+03:00,obsolete,"home this month popular  things indian guys have to understand when learning game  things indian guys have to understand when learning game february    comments culture 
as a guy of indian ethnicity there are some obstacles you have to overcome in order to have a balanced game circumstances can dictate what these are but following my last post a red pill infused indian pal of mine and myself had a conversation about what these obstacles are  let go of limiting beliefs about being an indian in the western world 
what do i mean by limiting beliefs there is a particular mindset among indian guys that they can only get with indian girls you must let go of these fears dictating that your ethnicity holds you back in what you can do being indian does not mean you have to work in it accounting business construction or own a corner shop as in the same way it does not mean you have to date indian girls  let go of your mummys sari 
its something ive noticed among the large indian community here in london there are a large number of mummys boys men who are afraid to stand up to their mothers and what they want themselves no one wants to disrespect their parents but also at the same time standing up for what you want should be your primary objective many a man will settle with their girlfriends due to pressure from their mothers as one acquaintance said he preempted conflict by just doing what his mother wanted even though he does not love the girl he married  let go and expand beyond your indian comfort zone 
your extended family plays a large part of your life not a bad thing but a lot of guys also have their friends circle exclusively indian expand your knowledge gain new friends travel and learn new languages its a difficult transition to move from becoming over reliant on this little setup to independence from all influence but it can be done and it will benefit your internal well being the thing to remember is you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with it is highly likely none of your existing five friends will agree with your path into game they will tell what is best for you but in essence this is them subconsciously pulling you back down to their value as you increase your own  stop putting white women on a pedestal 
white women are easy white women are fun white women are flirts white women are great at sex or white women are sluts whatever white women are as an indian guy you must stop putting them on a pedestal for being all these sexually related things that you think indian girls are not there is no magical things that white women do that others do not besides there is not a certain place in the world where white women will see you and jump on your cock as there is not a certain bollywood film that will make a white woman gush all wet and demand you ravage her aryan style white woman pedestalization can be categorized as an inferiority complex displayed by indian men stop thinking youre inferior to any woman regardless of her ethnicracial origins  understand that indian girls are not different and are not more chaste 
being constantly around these indian girls at family gatherings community events and religious events makes you programmed into believing that you will marry one for certain because of their chaste and low promiscuity a strong belief that indian girls dont ride the cock carousel is blind faith because they do in fact all women in the western world do regardless of culture and their strong family traditional values they are women they get pussy tingles to the same game as white black asian orange maroon and kiwi women they have the same subconscious processes as all women that help them place a value on a man and inevitable slamming and spunk gobbling if he passes with flying colors in a western society these girls have the same external pressures and influences that appeal to their inner slut as much as any other woman your objective as a man is not to fall into the line of romantic thinking that they are different  do not be afraid of the man 
theres a man a dominant man somewhere in your family he dictates he dominates and he makes the decisions you have a fear of causing him displeasure you do as he says as hes done the leading since your father emptied his ball sack into your mother stop as much as a lot of indian men have pressures from being mummys little lad theres plenty of them that disintegrate under the pressure of their fathers or uncles avoiding conflict is prevalent in your attitude you do as you are told even though your mind is telling you this is not in your interest and possibly not in the wider interests of those close to you but you do it as uncle or dad has told you to 
no one is telling you to fight but start slowly speak out say what you think is best for you get out of your shell and decide how you will live your life not how dad thinks you should live your life you might be scared of the conflict and dissuade yourself from it but trust me when you finally grow some balls and exude some confidence and ability in yourself these men will respect you see you as equal and place trust in your decisions 
this list could also apply to other cultures who follow similar dynamics to indian culture but dont stop at the above and think thats all you have to doyou still have to hit the ground running and approach just like any other guy learning game",english,prisonplanet.com,No Image URL,conspiracy,Fake,title,lately gunfree zones gun control laws rage among globalists liberals shapes usually circular

but the latest leak reveals that brazile had passed along a second debate question to hillary all this just emphasizes how fraudulent and rigged the whole debate process was 
another leaked email has emerged showing democratic national committee boss and former cnn contributor donna brazile sharing a debate question in advance with the hillary clinton campaign  despite braziles persistent claims to the contrary 
cnn announced in a statement soon after the email became public monday that brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it on oct  days after the controversy over brazile tipping off the clinton campaign initially broke 
according to documents released monday by wikileaks brazile sent clinton communications director jennifer palmieri an email titled one of the questions directed to hrc tomorrow is from a woman with a rash the night before the march  cnn primary debate in flint mich 
her family has lead poison and she will ask what if anything will hillary do as president to help the ppl of flint brazile wrote 
the following night leeanne walters a mom whose twin boys stopped growing and whose daughter lost her hair during the flint water contamination crisis posed a question to both clinton the eventual democratic presidential nominee and her primary opponent vermont sen bernie sanders

it was a standard day in the life of donald trumps presidential campaign as the republican nominee spent much of his time on the campaign trail thursday making outrageous and insulting comments 
this was on clear display at a rally in toledo ohio when trump proposed one of his most ridiculous ideas yet cancel the election and just anoint him president 
video trump jokes we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump right what are we even having it for her policies are so bad pictwittercomstzidbpf 
 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
im just thinking to myself right now we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump right trump asked the crowd what are we even having it for  her policies are so bad 
despite trumps plea to cancel the election as he continues to struggle in the polls it will be the voters who decide which candidate has the better policies  thankfully 
the remark also aligns closely with other recent comments in which trump claimed the process is rigged against him and he will only accept the outcome of the election if its favorable for him 
but trump wasnt done at his buckeye state rally he also made sure to take a dig at minority communities 
video help me out there did trump just say were going to work on our ghettos before mentioning inner cities violence and african americans pictwittercomvkqzslbh 
 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
trumps comments 
were gonna work on our ghettos  take a look at whats going on where you have pockets of areas of land where you have the inner cities and you have so many things so many problems so many horrible horrible problems  the violence the death the lack of education no jobs were gonna work with the africanamerican community and were going to solve the problem of the inner city  you cant walk out the street you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot 
the republican nominees ghetto comment is the newest addition to what is the standard trump narrative that black communities are hellscapes this particular set of remarks comes a day after he visited north carolina for a rally and told supporters  mostly white  that he would enact a new deal for black america

democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday that he believes the catholic church will change its position on samesex marriage the virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue the catholic church is also likely to follow suit speaking at the th annual human rights campaigns national dinner in washington the roman catholic senator reportedly said i think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who in the first chapter of genesis surveyed the entire world including mankind and said it is very good 
and besides he continued we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value by definition that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil religious and above all sexual liberties to the best of their abilities and im sorry that some people dont like it but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless and the catholic church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it which is what its doing right now 
kaine also added that if all else fails there are ways of making the catholic church listen to the voice of reason which is how he dubbed all those who advocate lgbt equality at the end of the day you know were a civilized people of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely he said then if that doesnt work well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are or rather the lbgt community will do that  and it has the supreme courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works it actually functions 
so what im saying here he argued is that while i respect the catholic church as im sure millions of americans do you know at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the christian faith and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it so when that happens and thats whats happening with condemning lgbt rights well state an ultimatum the united states of america more precisely the future president of the united states of america hillary clinton will state an ultimatum and that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of america and yes  the president of the country can do that 
and in case anybodys wondering  no donald trump wont do the same because he doesnt care about anyone other than donald trump on the other hand hillary clinton is a shining example of honesty integrity and democracy and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout america are loved respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term what happens after that is not our problem kaine concluded",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/1477585077063_510901622-635x357.jpg,conspiracy,Fake,trump says hed neutral israelis palestinians,email democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday believes catholic church change position samesex marriage virginia senator said like changed opinion issue catholic church also likely follow suit speaking th annual human rights campaigns national dinner washington roman catholic senator reportedly said think going change church also teaches creator first chapter genesis surveyed entire world including mankind said good besides continued talking country based founded democracy core value definition means every single person every single citizen able scratch encouraged practice civil religious sexual liberties best abilities im sorry people dont like deny samesex marriage country first one accept pointless catholic church also accepting instead condemning right kaine also added else fails ways making catholic church listen voice reason dubbed advocate lgbt equality end day know civilized people course first thing well act nicely ask nicely said doesnt work well use law legal system enable rather lbgt community supreme courts ruling samesex marriage crucial milestone legal system proves works actually functions im saying argued respect catholic church im sure millions americans know point going start acting contrary christian faith talking institution thats supposed first one front line defending happens thats whats happening condemning lgbt rights well state ultimatum united states america precisely future president united states america hillary clinton state ultimatum ultimatum either change stance samesex marriage pack bags get america yes president country case anybodys wondering donald trump wont doesnt care anyone donald trump hand hillary clinton shining example honesty integrity democracy rest assured everything power president make sure gays lesbians throughout america loved respected viewed equals presidential term happens problem kaine concluded,1.0
Ronald Nelson,2016-11-02T11:26:36.532+02:00,comment on nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails  fbi can access them any time by ronald nelson,"theres a reason david brock founder of the liberal group media matters for america chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super pacs and nonprofits
professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts brock wants his unregistered solicitor the bonner group to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason
david brock is laundering money 
 
related stories consumers need protection from new consumer protection bureau rule heres what the markets are telling us exposed profiteers of governing  and these are the ones who got caught brock has seven nonprofits three super pacs one  committee one llc one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in washington 
uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations
the bonner group his professional solicitor works off a commission every time money gets passed around bonner receives a  percent cut
 
follow the money 
nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants
but they arent required to disclose who gives them cash grants
this weak system of oneway verification is being abused by brock hes been cycling money between his organizations for years and the bonner groups  percent commission gets triggered after every pass
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency in  media matters for america raised more than  million
the bonner group was credited for raising these funds media matters paid it a  million commission

that same year media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum  an organization that shares office space with media matters

in  the franklin education forum reported  in total contributions and  percent of that total came from media matters
surprisingly though the franklin education forum gave full credit to bonner for raising that money it paid the fundraiser a  commission in 

notice what happened 
brocks media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum brocks franklin education forum credited the bonner group for raising those funds triggering the  percent commission brock paid the bonner group a  commission to solicit a cash grant  from himself it doesnt stop there 
after the franklin education forum retained  it sent a  cash grant to brocks franklin forum  

note the franklin education forum is a c and the franklin forum is a c they are not the same company 
the franklin forum c paid bonner a commission in   so its safe to assume the fundraiser received a  commission in  unfortunately its hard to tell for sure it still hasnt filed its taxes for 
lets recap 
say for example you donate  to media matters for america this is how david brock would have used your charitable donation in 
media matters would receive your  donation the bonner group would earn a  commission media matters would retain  next media matters would give whats left of your entire donation   to the franklin education forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin education forum would retain  the franklin education forum would then forward the remaining  to the franklin forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin forum would retain  in the end brocks solicitor would have pocketed  almost a third of your initial donation thats a far cry from the advertised  percent commission
as bizarre as that scenario may sound this is exactly what brock did in 
how can we be sure this is intentional 
brock is the chairman for each of these organizations how could he not know whats going on
hes a handson chairman according to their tax returns brock allocates time weekly to his organizations
media matters  hours per week franklin education forum three hours per week the franklin forum one hour per week furthermore the new york times reports that brock shares a summer rental in the hamptons with mary pat bonner the president of the bonner group
brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this these transfers are intentional he vacations with his solicitor case closed
still not convinced 
brock didnt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers they all share the same number

what if  
we even located the bonner groups solicitation agreement with media matters on floridas gift givers guide  clarification on the commission can be found on page 

in english contractually brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission in spite of this option he intentionally chooses to trigger the  percent commission for money grants between his organizations
note yes we are making the assumption that all of brocks organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the bonner group given that his organizations share the same address board members and telephone number we feel its safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement 
this barely scratches the surface 
utilizing publicfacing tax returns along with records submitted to the federal election commission we mapped out all the significant money transfers from  that took place in brocks office

summary 
this is all from just one year no further commentary required
we understand this may be hard to believe we first came across this in july and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it
all of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources check for yourself  we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in brocks office these data have been sitting out in the open gathering dust for years 
if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck
weve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity but there arent any loopholes david brock has something to hide just last month the daily caller reported the following
brocks former longtime livein boyfriend william grey whom brock has thanked in several of his books threatened to go to the irs with damaging information about how brock was running his media matters empire what did brock do he paid grey  to keep quiet brock reportedly had to sell his home in rehoboth delaware to come up with the money this certainly seems to indicate that brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover
adding to this fox news reported the following
grey accused brock of financial malfeasance and threatened to undermine brocks fundraising efforts
next step is i contact all your donors and the irs grey wrote in an email dated may   this is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now
we believe that the information presented in this article is what has brock so terrified we feel confident in saying with close to absolute certainty that david brock is laundering money through his media matters conglomerate

picture if you will video footage of vintage early  donald trump buffoonery with the ceo of cbs leslie moonves commenting on major medias choice to give trump vastly more air time than other candidates it may not be good for america but its damn good for cbs 
thats the introduction to a powerful critique of the us media a new film screens in new york and los angeles this week called all governments lie truth deception and the spirit of if stone  
the website allgovernmentsliecom has screening dates  a list of lies  and a list of good journalists who expose lies  the lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film but theres a good deal of overlap  enough to give you a sense of what this project is about 
id have made various changes and additions to the film in particular im tired of all the focus on iraq  this film touches on war lies since then but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence 
still this is a film that should be shown in cities homes and classrooms across the united states it includes and is driven by noam chomskys analysis of how the media system is rigged without those doing the rigging believing theyve done anything at all its a survey of skullduggery by corporate media its an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm and its an introduction to if stone it includes footage of a presentation of the annual izzy award which goes to journalists acting in stones tradition 
one of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the gulf of tonkin nonincident anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie and it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense that is had the north vietnamese really shot back at a us ship off their coast that would not have been any sort of legal much less moral justification for escalating a war id love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the black sea the red sea and every other part of the earth today 
but the gulf of tonkin lies about vietnamese aggression against the us ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the us role of global policeman someone had to make the lies transparent someone had to document that in fact the secretary of socalled defense and the president were lying sadly nobody did that in the first  hours after the congressional committee hearings and that was all it took for congress to hand the president a war 
and it was decades before white house transcripts came out and before the national security agency confessed and additional years before former secretary robert mcnamara did yet those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew and they knew it because of if stone who just weeks after the nonincident published a fourpage edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about tonkin 
stones analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the red sea off yemen and in fact it is to yemen that stone immediately turned on page  in  the united nations including its us ambassador had recently condemned british attacks on yemen that britain defended as retaliatory president dwight eisenhower had also warned the french against retaliatory attacks on tunisia and president lyndon johnson even at the time of tonkin stone notes was warning greece and turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other 
stone who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks the league of nations covenant the kelloggbriand pact and the un charter the latter two are still theoretically in place for the us government 
the united states in vietnam stone goes on to show could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of vietnamese boats and indeed the us ships stone reports were in north vietnamese waters and were there to assist south vietnamese ships that were shelling two north vietnamese islands and in fact those ships had been supplied to south vietnam by the us military and the good old american tax payers 
stone did not have access to closed committee hearings but he hardly needed it he considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war and then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees he found their denials to be nondenials and nonsensical it made no sense that the us ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the south vietnamese ships stone didnt believe it 
stone also filled in the background information the united states had been supporting guerrilla attacks on north vietnam for years prior to the nonincident and stone raised numerous suspicions including the question of why the us ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the nonincident to not occur and the question of why in the world vietnam would take on the united states military something nobody could explain though eugene mccarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-28T14:52:36.662+03:00,us navy iran giving terrorists missiles to fire at us ships,"hillarys secretary of state after  send a check for  million to iran   
were talking about tehran joe biden of course who is good pals with the iran lobby biden is reportedly hillarys fantasy cabinet pick for secretary of state because the democrats have decided that secretary of state is a job too important to be trusted to experienced diplomats but should instead be reserved strictly as a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates 
heres a flashback on bidens views  
democratic vicepresidential candidate joe biden was quoted monday as telling senior israeli officials behind closed doors that the jewish state will have to reconcile itself to a nuclear iran in the unsourced report army radio also quoted biden as saying that he opposed opening a additional military and diplomatic front army radio said israeli officials expressed amazement over the remarks attributed to him israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran army radio quoted biden as telling the unnamed officials 
bidens people loudly denied the report but he had a history of being tight w ith the iran lobby 
some might call it reaching out to american muslims but to many iranians living in california a fundraiser for sen joseph biden ddel at the home of a prominent proiran lobbyist on feb  sent a wrongheaded message to the ruling clerics in tehran 
when we learned that sen biden was planning to hold a fundraiser at the california home of dr sadegh namazikhah we immediately contacted his office to express our dismay a prominent iranianamerican activist tells insight why dismay 
dr namazikhah is wellknown in the los angeles area for his support of the ruling clerical regime in tehran and is one of the regimes leading unofficial lobbyists in america we thought that sen biden might not know his background getting the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee to appear at this event will certainly be seen by the regime in tehran as a show of support 
on the eve of the fundraiser which brought an estimated  into bidens reelection coffers a biden staffer told the activist that the senators staff had all the facts necessary to make a decision and he was planning to attend the fundraiser despite the protests 
several participants who paid to attend the event tell insight that biden arrived at  pm stayed until  and delivered a sweeping condemnation of president george w bushs axis of evil formula 
as senator biden was not only undermining bush but fundraising off it at the home of supporters of a terrorist enemy state 
biden also impressed many of those present with his friendly attitude toward the islamic republic of iran the senator said that iran always wanted to be an ally of the united states and to have good relations with the us according to housang dadgostar a prominent lawyer as iranianamericans we dont want anything to happen to the iranian government or to the iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism says mohsen movaghar a los angeles businessman both men belong to the member board of directors of namazikhahs iranian muslim association of north america iman 
namazikhah denied any official contact with the iranian government but he tells insight that he regularly travels to iran  something many expatriates do  and that he actively supports moderates within the ruling clergy such as iranian president mohammad khatami in their efforts to bring reform to the islamic system 
namazikhah and other iman board members say bidens office contacted them to inquire if they would hold a private fundraiser for the senator who is up for reelection this year after meeting with them at a protehran gala in new york last december that event was sponsored by the americaniranian council aic a proregime lobbying group trying to get congress and the bush administration to lift the trade embargo on iran 
but biden had the perfect post  reaction  
after september th biden suggested sending  million to iran no strings attached as a gesture of good faith to the arab world 
at the tuesdaymorning meeting with committee staffers biden launches into a streamofconsciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing before he finally admits the obvious im groping here then he hits on an idea america needs to show the arab world that were not bent on its destruction 
seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran biden declares 
he surveys the table with raised eyebrows a how do ya like that look on his face

hillary clinton personally ordered a consultant to use a nonprofit group to troll the trump campaign with a donald duck mascot according to the democratic operatives who say they arranged it with a nonprofit organization 
when breitbart news washington political editor matthew boyle confronted mook about creamer and his firm in the spin room after the third presidential debate mook claimed theyve never worked for our campaign when asked if clinton had ever discussed the controversial political operations with creamer directly mook replied i dont think so 
now however okeefe and project veritas have released video of creamer claiming that clinton directly approved one of his more bizarre plans  an effort to attract media attention and incite violence by dressing an activist in a donald duck costume and sending that activist into trump events emphasizing the argument that trump was ducking releasing his tax returns 
the action if true would be a blackletter violation of federal election law which prohibits presidential campaigns from coordinating activities with outside groups that can collect unlimited dark money from contributors  and dont pay taxes on what they collect

the death of john kennedy by michael rivero
there have been two official investigations one concluded oswald acted alone the other that there was a conspiracy after half a century many of the key documents which could tell the whole story remain classified john f kennedys brain is still missing from the national archives why if it is an open and shut case why the secrecy if oswald was just a crazed lone gunman 
the house select committee on assassinations concluded that john f kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy based on the recording of the gunshots fired in dealey plaza captured over a police radio a total of  impulses were caught on the tape but citing budgetary constraints the hsca only had  of them analyzed the analysis concluded that all  were gunshots two of them occurring within  a second of each other too close to be fired by one man comparisons of the echoes with test shots fired in dealey plaza confirmed that at least one of the recorded shots had indeed been fired from the grassy knoll needless to say the existence of  rather than just  gunshots destroyed the oswald as lone gunman coverup warren supporters quickly tried to dismiss the audio record of the gunshots by claiming that the recording was actually of gunshots in another part of the city and confused for dealey plaza shots because of a timing error without explaining just where the other shots had occurred or why the echo patterns exactly matched the test shots fired in dealey plaza the warren supporters declared victory new research has shown that the report that dismissed the audio recording of the gunshots was itself deeply flawed and ignored evidence that confirmed both the location and time of the recording as being in dealey plaza at the time of the jfk assassination this means that the original house select committee on assassinations conclusion is the correct one there were at least five gunshots in dealey plaza two of them within  second of each other and at least one of the shots came from the grassy knoll update the deathbed confession of cia agent e howard hunt to his son on the jfk assassination update numerous witnesses had reported a large obvious exit wound in the back of kennedys head consistent with the reports of a gunshot from the grassy knoll the warren commission dismissed the exit wound and reports of a shooter on the grassy knoll and published in their report photographs of the back of kennedys head that showed no damage now it has been revealed that the warren commission did not publish the actual autopsy photos but substituted photos taken after morticians had reconstructed kennedys head an anticipation of a possible open casket viewing prior to the funeral  as had been done with lincoln 
although described as a mixup the simplest explanation is deliberate deception by the warren commission dan rathers fib 
dan rather at the time an unknown newscaster from a small market texas tv station viewed the zapruder film then described it to america on the cbs network as this recording of that broadcast shows rather lied to all of america in claiming that the head shot pushed john f kennedys head forward 
rather makes the claim that kennedys head rocketed forward at  in the above video he also makes a point of saying there were only three shots in total rathers meteoric rise to network status and stardom soon followed this broadcast when the zapruder film was finally shown publicly during jim garrisons trial of cia agent clay shaw rathers lie was revealed for all to see a revealing wink 
most americans who lived through the kennedy assassination are very familiar with the above photo of vice president lyndon johnson being sworn in as president aboard air force one 
but very few people are aware of another photograph snapped just seconds later

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-30T13:39:16.355+02:00,obama donations funneled through fake bonuses,"exassistant fbi director clintons are a crime family october   
thats quite an endorsement  and if theres anything top fbi officials now its crime families certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that hillary can claim in any field 
the clintons thats a crime family basically former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said its like organized crime i mean the clinton foundation is a cesspool 
kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liar 
he also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private server 
the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that

Tonya Parnell,2016-10-30T12:06:18.987+02:00,comment on former us attorney for dc new hillary email probe was result of revolt inside fbi by tonya parnell,"posted on october   by the free thought project 
decadeold audio exposes thensenator hillary clinton saying the us should have manipulated palestinian parliamentary elections in  to prevent a hamas victory the presidential candidate lamented that the us didnt determine who was going to win 
i do not think we should have pushed for an election in the palestinian territories i think that was a big mistake thennew york senator clinton told the jewish press a new yorkbased weekly newspaper several months after the january election 
and if we were going to push for an election then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win she said 
until friday the comment clinton made on september   only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist eli chomsky an editor and a staff writer for the jewish press he interviewed clinton at the newspapers office in brooklyn 
chomsky who shared and played the tape for the observer says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with clinton during which the palestinian parliamentary election was among primary topics the comments have been posted on soundcloud 
speaking to the news portal he recalled being confused by the fact that anyone could support the idea  offered by a national political leader no less  that the us should be in the business of fixing foreign elections  audio emerges of clinton proposing election rigging in palestine censored by israeli press for past  years httpstcolsmycuzjr 
 wikileaks wikileaks october   
the interview took place nine months after the hamas movement claimed  of the  parliamentary seats pushing aside the usfavored fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet that victory was neither welcomed in israel nor in the us in washington where hamas is considered a terrorist organization officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a palestinian authority that included hamas 
thenpresident george w bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the power of democracy but refused to deal with hamas as long as it opposed israels existence and espoused violence 
that day in september  clinton made odd and controversial comments all now saved on the minute record that chomsky held onto all these years 
i went to my bosses at the time chomsky told the observer the jewish press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody  even a direct quote from anyone  in a position of influence because they might need them down the road my bosses didnt think it was newsworthy at the time i was convinced that it was and i held onto it all these years dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks share this",english,dcclothesline.com,http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Pipeline-KW-1-600x314.jpg,bs,Fake,hillary unpopular pay youth voters fabricate rallies,home search posted pamela geller clintons emailed aid us state department jake sullivan used personal email talk clinton bringing libya unsecured servers open see hillarys leadership libya led prior february day rage libya national budget surplus percent gdp oil production million barrels per day track reach goal million barrels per day currently oil production decreased percent following revolution libyan economy contracted estimated percent national deficit percent gdp revolution libya secure prospering secular islamic country critical ally providing intelligence terrorist activity postseptember qaddafi longer threat united states yet secretary state hillary clinton strongly advocated succeeded convincing administration support libyan rebels nofly zone intended prevent possible humanitarian disaster turned quickly allout war huma abedin human network graph based wikileaks clinton emails courtesy pamela geller dont forget follow dc clothesline facebook twitter please help spread word sharing articles favorite social networks share,1.0

bill still  good morning im still reporting on chan 
if truepundit is right again then there are movements of fbi agents tonight that suggest a massive raid happening tomorrow in the dc metro area that may involve arrests and seizure of evidence in the clinton foundation investigation 
i think i can hear the sound of thousands of computers being scrubbed by bleachbit from leesburg virginia to bowie maryland when i walk outside and if so then tomorrow a mighty blow for freedom will be struck as the first step towards the restoration of the rule of law is taken 
but first this letter from anonymous writing on chan making some interesting predictions 
first of all what is chan 
see also sr   huma abedin flipped in nypd slimy sex probe  crooked hillary may be involved 
it is a message board that is designed from the ground up to be totally anonymous users dont even have to pick a username posts are time sensitive  less time for rrated discussion threads  more time for g or pg rated ones so the reliability of the comments can only be judged by knowledge of the context surrounding the comments 
i did a story on chan on aug   still report   since i thought it was true i ran the story then now it no longer seems a bit flaky because much of it has panned out 
the particular chan thread that pertained to whether or not hillary clinton would not be recommended for indictment by fbi director jim comey was announced by an anonymous fbi analyst 
now management of the thread has apparently been taken over by anonymous the previous author may have met his fate at the hands of the conspirators attempting to steal the american election what follows is the message dated nov    
over the next few days many new documents will be released the contents of these documents will contain evidence of perhaps the largest coverup in american history 
before this happens we would like to explain ourselves and answer a few questions you may have 
until this month wikileaks and anonymous have worked together building an efficient detailed comprehensive set of documents that would be responsible for the incarceration of hillary clinton bill clinton and  individuals ranging from the dnc fbi cia and clinton foundation 
these documents will show without a doubt the evidence of treason obstruction of justice election fraud manipulation and bribery 
this was intended to be the october surprise but before the release of these documents we were contacted by a member of the fbi as well as another from the cia and a week later by the nypd all with information pertaining to something much darker than even we imagine due to the nature of these leaks we all work together as efficiently as possible to ensure two objectives  that all necessary information would be given to the public in an organized searchable manageable way  those who provided us with this information would be able to find safety before these releases were made this concern wasnt without warrant 
the new leaks being released this week will provide documents in the form of emails pictures and videos within these will be evidence of bill clinton as well as at least six other government officials taking part in sexual acts with minors as well as evidence of human trafficking that also included minors we believe these pictures and videos were taken for the purpose of political manipulation in order to make sure all participants followed through on a previously agreed agenda 
these documents were given to us by an american government official when he had come to learn that this crime had been covered up by hillary and her staff through methods including bribery and blackmail he also told us that due to the restricted access of these documents they would soon know he was the one who released them to us we were trying to make arrangements for him to exit the country safely but he was killed before those arrangements could be carried out

why does everyone think that presidential campaigns are about issues when anyone over the age of consent knows they are all about sex but it says a lot about the lasting power of viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventyyearolds on the ballot  for an election lasting more than four years please call your doctor  
in last weeks newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman i have lost track to come forward to say that donald trump made suggestive and inappropriate advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago 
the woman in question is jessica drake who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament she was working in the the adult industry thats what people magazine calls porn for wicked pictures the th century fox of gang banging when the randy donald kissed and hugged her in his room 
trump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door together with two friends normally in the adult business when three porn stars knock on your hotel door its considered foreplay 
when trumps effusive greeting of miss drake did not lead to more snuggling let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television he offered her  to satisfy his suite dreams 
drake again demurred saying that the next morning she needed to get back to los angeles for work by that point in her career she had already notched screen credits for extreme doggie and fornocopia i would mention other titles but as they say at the new york post  this is a family newspaper 
that rejection prompted donald to offer jessica an early morning ride of shame on his trump airliner back to la which still didnt turn the trick    
then last week in the presence of her lawyer gloria allred the perry mason of many cases against bill cosby miss drake tearfully repeated in primetime her shock and dismay that mr trump had tried to take liberties with her reputation which after all includes the  adult video news award for the best double penetration sex scene in her classic work fallen 
drake said she was coming forward now to stand in solidarity with the other women trump has manhandled although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of drakes new online store where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her guide to bdsm for beginners among other titles 
normally scenes such as the one i am describing would be consigned to john oliver monty python or saturday night live  but in the new normal of presidential politics even miss drake gets a respectful hearing on the issues 
for example the next day the huffington post reported woman says trump sexually assaulted her offered her  for sex 
the deadpan new york times wrote ms drake who appeared saturday with the womens rights lawyer gloria allred said mr trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission 
the headline in new york magazine read adult actress jessica drake details trump assault blasts him for uncontrollable misogyny 
look i have no doubt that trump is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the adult industry    
sadly the answer to this question dates to winter  when bill and hillary clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform 
during the  super bowl the clintons appeared on a halftime special of  minutes to deny jointly bill that allegation is false  that he had ever had an affair with gennifer flowers who lived in little rock arkansas when bill was governor and often out jogging 
in this vaudeville performance hillary played the straight man adding you know im not sitting heresome little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette at least she didnt reference the eagles 
only in  under oath in a sworn deposition did bill admit to having a year affair with ms flowers but neither her allegations in  nor his lying about it cost him the election that year 
just the opposite clintons wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters no strangers to sexual boredom who found they had more in common with a softshell baptist bill than an uptight protestant george hw bush 
nor did clintons impeachment in  for lying about his affair with monica lewinsky under oath in the paula jones case hurt his postpresidential career worth  million  or the electoral prospects of his wife in  
but it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue which is one of the reasons why this years race seems only to be about sex    
no doubt the clintons do find some delicious irony in trumps groping charges as payback for what they view as the republican use of sexuality to impeach bill in  and in  for the gop plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites cut to an online image of the white house and over it a fading picture of bill smoking a cigar with the caption here we go again 
without the pageantloving casino operating donald trump as the republican nominee in  hillary clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front with bills mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that hillary organized the slutshaming 
instead of the  election turning on hillarys marriage to hugh hefners doppelgänger the storyline that has played best in the media is donalds secret life as a groper 
the press actually has given trump a pass for his adultery which produced all those wonderful children but zeroed in on his groping in part because he confessed to it on an nbc videotape and also becausethink of ratingsgropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways crowed elevators or near schoolyards 
best of all for the clintons politically anyway is that the charge of groping is impossible for trump to refute even denying it sounds sleazy 
and it colors all aspects of the campaign to wit the new york times headline when at gettysburg trump outlined his vision for america donald trump pledges to heal divisions and sue his accusers    
for its mudslinging i am sure the trump campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar hillary as a lesbian but even that innuendo has fallen flat despite the rumor mongering that shes in a boston marriage with her assistant huma abedin whose husband anthony weiner is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms 
several of bills former lovers sally miller dolly kyle and flowers have tried to play up bills pillow talk that hillary prefers the nighttime company of women but none of these allegations have gone further than infowars or the supermarket press  hillary hit man tells all  
nor have outofwedlock children a staple of the  campaign as was chanted to grover cleveland  ma ma where  s my pa  gotten much play in this years presidential race 
trump and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that danney williams is bill clintons illegitimate son by a little rock prostitute named bobbie ann williams 
trump invited danney a sympathetic man to the third presidential debate as if to press on bill a scarlet letter despite williams looking very much like president bill the story got no more traction than did the news that malik obama the presidents shunned halfbrother is supporting trump he too got a debate invitation to sit in the box presumably marked shame 
also in the dustbin of history are the allegations that flowers aborted bills baby in  and the whispering campaign a great political standby when proof is elusive that chelsea is the product of an affair between hillary and her then law firm colleague webb hubbell 
the williams and hubbell stories come with some convincing internet similarities at least in the photographs although in both cases politically this rumor milling whiplashed against trump as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his birther past something that has stuck as campaign mud    
technically birtherism doest directly involve sex although it lingers on its fringes as it speaks to barack obamas illegitimacy his foreign allegiances and possibly disputed paternity including the claim that frank marshall davis was actually obamas biological father another subterranean creed of trumpism 
again the documentary proof is a series of lookalike photographs as close as the internet gets to dna that davis was an american communist works well in the campaign as it suggests the origins of obamas political genetic code 
ironically for all his efforts at smear trump came out the loser in the debates when hillary nailed him to birtherism which has become a convenient code word for trumps racism misogyny and intolerance of immigrants especially muslims 
nor in response did trump have any luck in linking the birther movement to clintons  campaign when according to donald consiglierejournalist sidney blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that barack was born in kenya 
instead the debate claim only made trump look disingenuous clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in  and at this point no one cares but voters do remember trump as the imperial wizard of birtherism    
republicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in  along lines of sexual preference or deviance although this strategy was based on hillary being the democratic nominee and anyone other than trump standing for the republicans 
had the gop nominee been carly fiorina jeb bush or john kasich clinton inc might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity illegitimacy and rape cue up the paula jones description of bill during a business meeting exposing himself in a little rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for  
instead the republicans went with the polyamorous trump who in addition to three marriages has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since  has been leering at miss universe contestantsa bit like austin powers  shall we shag now or shall we shag later  
with trumps resumé of creepy perversion you might have thought that the republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook instead they doubled down to make the case that both clintons if elected would turn the white house into a strip club 
not only did the clintons shrug off such innuendo but in response they said in effect if they did it would be to cater to the likes of players such as donald j trump leisure suit and open collar optional    
for the momentand i cant see anything changing in the last days of the campaignthe accepted wisdom of most front pages is that donald trump has groped as many women as tiger woods has watched pole dancing in vegas even the gallery of their women looks about the same 
conversely few voters seem to care that bill might have forced himself on several women or that hillary helped to cover up his brutality thats a narrative of the s which is perhaps the last time austin danger trump read the newspaper  ive been frozen for  years ive got to see if my bits and pieces are still working  
for most voters in  names such as kathleen willey or juanita broaddrick are as lost in time as nan britton who just before the  election bore a love child with then candidate senator warren harding 
britton and the child got republican hush money and a sad little house in asbury park new jersey after harding won she was invited to the white house but their affair so to speak was kept in the closet    
if you think about elections as political sitcoms in  the kennedys had to run as rob and laura petrie on the dick van dyke show  complete with twin beds long flannel pajamas and prudent kisses on the cheek to say goodnight even if the jfk reality show would make trump bill clinton and tiger look like apprentices at adultery 
come  only something that resembles modern family and a desperatehousewives reality show can crack network primetime and who better to put on air than the clintons with their dallas like money communal sexuality and more illicit storylines than csi  
for more than twenty years bill and hillary have been bringing us seasons of lust affairs ididnothavesexwiththatwoman vince foster travelgate foundation slush funds basement servers commodity trading whitewater bosnian snipers paytoplay benghazi lost emails and the like and the ratings only continue to go up 
sure the apprentice was fun for a few episodes but the sameness of insulting young people grew tedious how is that supposed to compete with bill making a pass at huma while her husband goes to prison for airing his junk and chelsea finding out about her real father next on the

Jon Anthony,2016-11-03T03:01:20.445+02:00,game is a modern rite of passage that helps turn boys into men,"i remember signing up for facebook ten years ago at this point in time the new social media site was geared mostly toward college students and it was uncommon for anyone over the age of  to have an account 
but over the last decade weve seen facebook morph into a  billion conglomerate and information kingpin acquiring massive power and wealth from the endless amounts of time users waste scrolling through their news feeds this beast of a social media platform has gone on to consume the lives of millions gather nefarious amounts of data foster unnecessary personal dramas and often cause more harm than good for its users 
it would be prudent to take a good hard look at your facebook experience and ask yourself if its something thats actually adding value to your life here are five reasons why you should think carefully before using the worlds largest social media site 
 your facebook feed is a black hole of completely worthless information 
i think its important to create streams of information that add real value to your life through platforms such as twitter feedly and youtube ive followed writers and content producers that have dedicated their lives to selfimprovement entrepreneurship higher meaning and the search for truth 
so you can probably imagine the stark difference between an intellectually curated twitter feed and the dumbeddown facebook community of people you went to high school with that peaked in the th grade 
log into your facebook and the most common information youll likely find is who got married who had kids and who got fat scrolling through your facebook feed is akin to flipping through a more personalized celebrity gossip magazine at the grocery store checkout line 
every time i log onto facebook im immediately reminded why i never log onto facebook 
 its no longer useful for dating 
in college i gained some value out of the site by using its chat feature to build up attraction with girls in my social circle and get their phone numbers 
but over the years most girls have attached the creepy stigma to guys who hit them up via facebook messenger 
in addition to that you dont really need a facebook profile for social proof as you once did since instagram is a better social media app for meeting girls  
 forfeiture of your privacy 
most people have realized by now that the first thing a potential employer will do after interviewing you is look you up on facebook theyre basically searching for any and every reason not to hire you lock your account down as best you can with privacy functions dont let that one drunk picture of you from  years ago ruin a potential job offer 
if that wasnt enough facebook has a long history of shady activities when it comes to privacy theyve already been caught accessing your location without permission we can only speculate what else theyve been infringing on

 censorship 
although facebook has a right to control the information broadcasted on its platform that doesnt mean they should abuse that right by censoring anything they might find disagreeable or offensive 
much like an overbearing parent facebook proactively controls the discourse of its children eagerly censoring content that might rub someone the wrong way facebook has so many overreaches that an entire website has been dedicated to documenting their affronts on freedom of opinion you can probably guess which side of the political spectrum they try to stifle

 it brings out the worst in people 
plenty of time has now passed for indepth research to come out regarding the longterm effects that too much facebook can have on a persons mental wellbeing it gives the illusion that everyone else has it better than you and that your life just isnt fair this is a slippery slope into a victim mindset and blaming others for your circumstances how oppressed these chronic facebook users are as they sip lattes from a comfy chair in starbucks and scroll through their facebook feeds on the latest macbook

i wont completely deny the merits of facebook if youre using it to build a brand or a business then it could be a good investment of your time simply because so many people actively use it ive also witnessed the joy it brings to older users for connecting with long lost friends they havent seen in decades 
but the truth is that in many cases facebook does cause more trouble than its worth its never a bad idea to cut back on your usage or even just opt out entirely you may no longer be the first to know about an upcoming dinner party or what brad and sarah from freshman year have been up to all these years but i suspect you might be better off as a person

donald trumps deplorable supporters arent waiting for the election results to start spilling blood 
theyve been threatening bloody violence ever since trump began claiming that the election is rigged in favor of hillary clinton and trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places 
in texas last week a trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of trumps stupid hats and a deplorables tshirt to vote 
election code prohibits any person from electioneering within  feet of a polling place 
of course trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules dont apply to them 
well now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down 
at collin college in plano texas a trump sign was discovered ziptied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places 
but when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside the blades sliced into the volunteers hands and drew blood requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal 
it just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody whos probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other local democratic party campaign chair steve spainhouer said in response  i think most people have already made their minds up at this point how theyre going to vote and so theres nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful 
heres the video via ktvt  
frankly this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism trumps supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as election day approaches and if trump loses his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup 
clearly these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger but you wont hear donald trump condemning this act of violence after all he is the one inciting it

Jean-Batave Poqueliche,2016-10-27T23:15:22.049+03:00,the most important concepts the manosphere taught me,"firearms panics happen over a variety of things like acts of domestic terrorism mass shootings or democrats getting elected to office though we may not have to worry about this for a few years after nd amendment enthusiast donald trumps decisive victory last night lets cover our bases and talk about a panic if future democrats are elected
what is a panic for ammo and firearms a panic is when people go and buy items just to have them because they are worried that there will soon be no more or it will be illegal to buy and sell such items but maybe not to own them already as most americans still believe in the no ex post facto laws part of the constitution
adding to a panic is speculators who buy from retailers who are roundly shamed if they raise their own prices only to resell privately at much higher levels while this is legal it certainly isnt ethical or a decent thing to do and these folks deserve being shamed and mocked at every opportunity
lastly the gun stores or sites inventory cannot handle the flex in the buying demand nor can the manufacturer and an artificially contrived panic creates a real scarcity that can only be corrected by the panic running out of steam as everyone buys what they consider to be enough and natural undercutting resets the price back to lower levels
some prices never return  long rifle ammunition has still not totally recovered from the damage old brock the islamic shock obama did to it with his multiyear championship of best firearms salesman ever and it may be even worse under the bitch in chief
so what gets grabbed in a panic what should you get what should you count on still being available weve got three categories guns ammo and componentsaccessories
guns anything thats big on the liberal hit list is a first target for a ban so its a first target for a panic look for things that are popular with the right and scary to the left also look for things that are modern no one is going to ban the m garand anytime soon
evil features matter more than destructive power anyone who knows anything about guns knows that the ak and the ar fire intermediate cartridges that are puny enough to be considered inhumane in several states with which to hunt deer as they lack the power to kill the animal with marginal shots however theyre black and have mean things attached to them so theyre on the shit list while a nice blued with wooden stock scoped bolt action rifle in a magnum cartridge capable of wrecking your world from twice the distance that an ar can pull is safe as it looks traditional

they have to be popular to the left to get noticed rifles like the fal and anything based of the ghk action simply dont have enough exposure to get targeted unless they pull something sweeping like the usc  r rules again the mini  and the ma might be safe maybe
for pistols pretty much any semiautomatic of the polymer age is fair game to want banned oftentimes stupid rules like restrictive magazine sizes get pushed s hi powers other old domestic semiautos and revolvers should be safe expect the libtards to go after glocks and the like
shotguns seem to be immune these days as theres not a whole lot of difference between a hunting gun and a combat gun other than paint and mag tube length i think the saigas are still not being imported and its about the only box mag fed one out there but anything else makes a good home defense gun that should also be immune to the ammo panic portion as well
ammunition range full metal jacket and defensehunting hollow or soft point cartridges in popular centerfire calibers and  long rifle will almost literally evaporate from your local store and online and its probably beginning as i write this
oddly enough only certain rounds will suffer panic buying for rifles its limited to   and  traditional hunting rounds like   and  do not seem to be impacted why doesnt  get bought in a panic as the old joke goes men with s dont panic but it really has to do with the feedback cycle i mentioned at the start if theres little demand it cannot exceed the instore supply so the perception of it being gone for good cannot occur
everything but the shotgun shell and the howitzer round to the far right will sell fast in a panic
panic bought pistol ammo is the big  mm luger  sw and  acp  will round out the affected semiautomatic rounds and there usually is a bit of a run on  magnum and  special as well mm  sig  gap and other magnums like the  do not seem to be affected
for rimfires  long rifle just goes poof while its magnum brother and smaller  caliber cousins do not seem to be as affected rimfires are not reloadable and this contributes to their overstockpiling
components and accessories most centerfire ammo is reloadable and the serious amongst shooters will roll their own for economy selfreliance and performance so the consumable components will also get some panics although ive held off on reloading articles until i get my press set back up we can hit up the components that will get panic bought briefly

biggest thing is primers even bigger than the bullets oddly enough the primer is the little metal cup that gets smacked by the firing pin and sets off the powder in modern cartridges and they come in two sizes for pistols two for rifles and of varying hardness to satisfy military specifications
the second is gunpowder itself fortunately theres a wide variety of smokeless powder and everyone tends to have the brands and formulas they prefer so it takes a little less of a hit than the primers the third is the bullets and since there are so many types and manufacturers they also take a little less of a hit than primers while you obviously need all three to reload bear that in mind always save your brass and anyone elses you can pick up
even though the little ones are easier to use the higher capacity ones disappear first get both
while it is always a good idea to have spare springs and small parts like firing pins and extractors that are prone to breakage the number one accessory or part to take a hit in panics is the box magazine especially high capacity ones i dont mean the  round drum mags although those do take a dive nor do i really mean the  round coffin mags but i mean the full capacity full sized pistol mags like a  round mag for a full sized pistol or a  round ar mag expect to see pmags and surplus style aluminum ar mags just vanish the gabby giffords special the extended glock   round mag is also a contender for vanishing fast in a panic
holsters slings cleaning accessories optics and ammo cans seem to be immune from panics
what to do if you already own a carbine andor a semiauto pistol make sure you have enough ammo magazines and spare parts its a lot better to have one gun with multiple mags and a lot of ammo than many guns with the one or two mags with which they came from the factory and a couple boxes of ammo
i try to have at least six mags for my semiauto pistols and at least ten mags for my semiauto rifles get some rifle mags of different sizes the  and  ar mags are fun for shooting standing up but they get in the way of prone firing and the  and  rounders are preferable
your ultimate ammo goal i maintain should be a thousand practice rounds and  defense rounds for each gun you have but in a prepanic or panic situation just get what you can at a normal price some is better than none if youre into reloading you know what to get already
if you dont own anything and want to soon refer to some pistol articles  a rifle article a shotgun article and a buying guide here consider buying some stripped ar lowers to build on a rainy day later on
build an ar and meet girls at the range
conclusion no matter who got elected i think this country is in for rough times its always better to have firearms and not need them then not have them and need them store yours safely but accessible and ready in times of need

the dakota access pipeline slicing through four states of the u s also creates smalltown divisions where some business owners near the protest camp have plenty to say on the subject they declined to give their names publicly though for fear of sending away customers 
in the tiny town of solen which is on the standing rock sioux reservation and about a half hours drive from the protest camps some business owners are walking a difficult line 
for instance a nonindian garage owner is married to a sioux woman who sides with the opponents  while he finds the whole controversy a nuisance 
i think most of the people around here native and nonnative would like to see it end its a big inconvenience all the traffic the cops i am for the pipeline north dakota is an oilproducing state he said and its the safest way to transport it 
at home the dividing line is clear she is convinced the pipeline is going to break and people are going to die he said of his wife shes got her view and ive got mine 
up the dirt road off the main highway is the last chance saloon decorated with branding irons large longhorn cattle horns and solid advice on a bumper sticker stuck on the wall when in doubt let your horse do the talking

i wish it would end im sick of it she said pouring fresh coffee for visitors into styrofoam cups and they keep coming more and more

we want to protect our land and we want to protect our water said dave archambault ii tribal chairman our concerns and interests dont matter and this is how we have been treated for over  years 
once roaming the great plains living in teepees and hunting buffalo the sioux leaders such as sitting bull red cloud and crazy horse are household names their bloodiest battles are too wounded knee custers last stand 
the history of the sioux people and the united states is one of broken promises and seizing land for white settlement gold mining and development those lands were reserved for the indians sole use in peace treaties that were supposed to be the highest law of the land

André du Pôle,2016-11-03T20:55:28.790+02:00,more emotions men should master,"before trumps glorious victory over the forces of progressive darkness i promised that i would provide a roadmap on what traditional men could do next to usher in a return of the patriarchy if hillary had prevailed the roadmap would have been a grim one as all of our work would have had to take place underground happily we will be able to work in the open here are three ways that we can leverage trumps victory to bring back the patriarchy
rule yourself bruce wayne is a good role model for traditional men urbane fit financially independentand dangerous
this may seem obvious but if we are going to bring back the patriarchy we have to be men who are worthy of it a patriarch who relies solely on the fact that he is a man will quickly be overthrown however a man who has authority because he has earned it by the way he lives will naturally retain it thus the first step in making progress under a trump administration is the same as it would have been if hillary had been electedselfimprovement
selfimprovement involves the obvious things getting in shape training martial arts getting rid of addictions and exercising selfdiscipline the process of selfimprovement needs to be undergirded with a philosophy of life for most men this will involve adopting and faithfully living one of the faithtraditions for others it may mean adopting stoic philosophy whatever it is it will have to be more substantial than the degenerate pleasure wealth and power at any cost morality of our spirit cooking eliteslack of morality got us into this problem in the first place
selfimprovement also involves moving in the direction of financial independence under a trump administration this last goal will become easier to achieve trumps tax plan cuts tax rates across the board this will especially benefit men who are in the middle class who are trying to generate more income they will be able to keep their savings so that they can move ahead rather than paying a penalty that keeps them from becoming wealthy
trumps emphasis on fair trade will also result in more american jobs and unleash unprecedented creativity the age of trump will be a great time to start a new business one word of warning is in order though under trump the us is likely to flourish in a way that hasnt happened since the the s enjoy the prosperity but dont get caught back in the materialism merrygoround our goal is a lifetime of financial independence not conspicuous consumption
financial independence is an important practical consideration because you will need a firm financial foundation for the second step which is ruling your family
rule your family be the patriarch
starting with the boomers our society rejected the traditional way of life and adopted progressivism families got smaller divorce became more common promiscuity increased feminism became the default philosophy for girls and the remaining vestiges of the patriarchy vanished progressivism promised freedom but delivered enslavement to political correctness and globalism
a trump administration will do little to reverse the deleterious effects that progressivism has had on the family at best the only thing government can do for the family is encourage it financially and provide a safe environment for it but real change has to come from the bottom upfrom men and women who return to tradition for us that means finding a traditional woman or more likely one who can be converted to tradition getting married and having lots of children a twitter shitlord  johnrandom  drove home this point in a humorous way by suggesting with a fourstep trump bump starter kit




getting married having children and raising them to hold to the patriarchy is the long game but it is the only way we will have long term victory without a next generation of traditional men any ground that we gain under trump will soon be lost
rule societybring back the patriarchy benjamin franklin is a great example of a man who was serious about his civic duty
the next thing that we must do is start reclaiming our institutions trump has captured the presidency and republicans control congress but many of those republicans are cucks who will oppose the trumpian agenda and our other institutions are still dominated by leftists hollywood the news media education and corporations all proclaim the progressive antipatriarchy message if we dont take advantage of the current moment any gains that trump makes will be quickly rolledback after he leaves office
therefore we need to start reengaging with these institutions to shift them towards patriarchal nationalism  you can share any ideas you have to do this in the comments here id like to suggest that one institution that needs our participation the republican party trump has created many allies within the gop but the majority of the party still holds to the cucked ideology of open borders and bad trade deals like nafta the gop desperately needs likeminded men within its ranks who will help trump achieve his vision
getting involved in your local gop is easy you merely have to get in touch with your local party leadership in your district you dont have to run for elected office simply volunteer your time in getting local officials elected voting for delegates or attending gop events go in with a respectful attitude a lot of the local gop leaders are good people who still dont understand that the real battle is against globalists work for incremental change and if you have the disposition required for it consider running for local office yourself
one piece of advice if you do choose to get involved in politics dont get caught up in it one way we ended up with an ossified and outoftouch gop is that people started to hold the globalist neoconservatism with an almost religious fervor the other trap is to use politics as a way of enriching oneself in the manner of hillary clinton if you do choose to enter the political realm resolve at the outset to not use it for your own financial gain dont make politics your life think of it strictly as civic duty
of course politics is not everybodys cup of tea the key is to use your gifts whether that is in moviemaking or in running a company to help create an environment where the patriarchy can flourish
conclusion the one thing we must not do in wake of the trump victory is rest on our laurels if hillary had won wed all have a great sense of urgency to protect what little remained of our way of life now that trump is coming into power the temptation is to relaxto just let trump do it all this temptation must be avoided we must capitalize on the trump victory with the same high level of urgency that we would have regarded a hillary victory if we dont we run the risk of losing all the ground we have gained

Alex Ansary,2016-11-02T18:36:20.532+02:00,russias most potent weapon hoarding gold,"wikileaks documents reveal united nations interest in ufos  
huffington post 
revelations in a set of hacked emails released by wikileaks earlier this month have sparked new conversations about ufos and speculation that extraterrestrials have been visiting earth but a very significant  and possibly overlooked  group of wikileaks items relevant to the topic was released on may   
wikileaks posted more than half a million us state department diplomatic documents from  detailing americas interactions with countries all around the world  including grenada prime minister eric gairys efforts to organize a united nationsbased committee to research and investigate global ufo reports 
many of the documents written by american un officials indicated how closely they were monitoring grenadas uforelated activities 
one document  from nov   revealed my involvement in helping grenada to produce a credible ufo presentation 
i had an opportunity in early  to meet gairy in new york to present an idea about how i thought the un would pay attention to his ufo crusade through his ambassadors i gave him a copy of a documentary record album ufos the credibility factor that i produced for cbs inc in  
gairy and i met and after i convinced him i could bring a very credible group of speakers to the un he agreed to sponsor my proposal see image below shortly after a handshake deal he made me a temporary delegateadviser of grenada and the rest was well history courtesy of lee speigel this  letter from grenada to lee speigel confirmed that countrys commitment to sponsor speigels ufo presentation at the united nations 
the following image shows part of the group i brought together in july  to meet with un secretarygeneral kurt waldheim he wanted to know what we were planning to do at our november event in front of the special political committee which included representatives from the committee on the peaceful uses of outer space courtesy of lee speigel on july   producer lee speigel now a huffington post writer brought together a group of military scientific and psychological experts to meet with united nations secretarygeneral kurt waldheim to discuss speigels upcoming presentation to the un special political committee later that year topic the importance of establishing an international ufo committee pictured from left usaf astronaut col gordon cooper astronomer jacques vallee astronomerastrophysicist claude poher astronomer j allen hynek grenada prime minister sir eric gairy waldheim morton gleisner of the special political committee lee speigel researcher leonard stringfield and university of colorado psychologist david saunders 
another cable posted on wikileaks  from nov   refers to ambassador richard petrees meeting with grenada representatives to discuss their ufo resolution ambassador petree acknowledged the high level of interest in ufos among some elements of the private sector and scientific community  and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the us and other countries 
on nov   the day after our presentation at the un this document was sent through official channels detailing the actual ufo event describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations 
a few days after that on dec   a followup cable was transmitted including the following 
subsequent to the introduction of the grenadian ufo resolution misoff mission officer has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions which included representation from austria ussr and grenada in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem 
a draft decision to be taken by the special political committee spc has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations subject to concurrence of their respective capitals we think referral of the ufo matter to the outer space committee osc without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken provides the flexibility the osc needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate 
it will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution and gamble on the results 
the following week brought forth another document  on dec   which stated 
the general assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life including unidentified flying objects and to inform the secretarygeneral of the observations research and evaluation of such activities

breaking leaked  memo from attorney kumiki gibson to clinton foundation chairman bruce lindsay gibson had been hired to do an independent assessment of the foundations practices 
below are key quotes from gibsons findings keep in mind that the clinton foundations very existence depends on it being legally certified as a nonprofit entity in compliance with laws governing nonprofits break those laws and its nonprofit status would be revoked and the whole operation would go down the drain 
gibson important responsibilities regarding corporate filings are delegated to the foundation cfo who appears to delegate them to an outside organization with very little oversight by the legal department as a result the foundation is not in compliance with the filings rules including in new york which requires the foundation to be certified to do business in the state apparently the clinton foundation was not legally registered as a nonprofit in new york 
gibson no matter what the leadership decides about the larger overarching question it must act immediately to bring the foundation into compliance with the law and standards that govern notforprofits and must create strong legal and hr offices so to prevent any lapses in the future 
gibson the foundation does not have a record retention policy and the procedures currently utilized in harlem headquarters may violate the law 
zero hedge writes furthermore and more troubling the gibson review pointed to a highranking but unnamed foundation executive who was being paid by president clinton the government and the foundation who allowed the foundation to host what may have been or may have been viewed as a political event apparently without official preapproval from the foundations legal department and without regard before the fact to the impact of that decision on the foundations tax exempt status 
this memo was written in  it would have taken then and it would now take about a month of investigation by new york state and us dept of justice officials to nail down the particulars and sink the clinton foundation 
that didnt happen then will it happen now not if the dept of justice has anything to say about it the clintons are protected 
but evidence of the foundation corruption is spreading like wildfire some fires are impossible to contain

Matthew Everett,2016-10-26T22:46:58.887+03:00,no title,"while democrats perpetually circle the wagons republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad the same holds true for many evangelicals democrats and secularists count on it 
and we never disappoint 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and finally settled as a reluctant trumper i like any godfearing father of daughters was and remain appalled by donald trumps sordid past and his yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women his words are indefensible and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day 
still i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov  in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote for better or worse for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov mike pence 
regrettably with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness 
even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong 
and then there are the selfrighteous plankintheeye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  
mrs clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother 
during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage 
this is homicide plain and simple hillary clinton supports it donald trump opposes it 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs clinton and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs clinton still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court 
its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs clinton by voting for mr trump this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations 
with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil 
history will reflect as much 
under a president hillary clinton millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive under a president donald trump these millions might live and yet even as hillary sharpens her knives we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth

even after the election the clinton side continues with lawless agitation intimidation and violence in the streets demonstrating to reasonable people everywhere that americans did make the right choice thank you msm and mr soros for showing everyone just how free democratic big hearted and open the globalist new world order would really be if hillary had won 
if the us election rules had been that the candidates had to win the popular vote in order to be elected then trump would have campaigned more vigorously in the large cities and likely also would have won that contest in a landslide but how much more of a landslide that would have been can be seen by considering what really happened 
the people who supported trump mainly voted for jobs and to save core values and constitutional rights from a misguided globalism being imposed upon them they were essentially voting to save their nation from an establishment which has been systematically outsourcing just about everything which matters to them however despite the stakes they were and remain essentially principled people adhering to the electoral rules of fair play for lawful democratic change the clinton side on the other hand appeared devoid of any real principles other than their own interests during the election the clinton side used intimidation tactics of paid agitators they cheated by swelling voters lists by opening the border and signing up droves of illegal immigrants even voter fraud and rigged voting machines were acceptable to them but most of all they were supported by an absolutely biased corrupt and lying mainstream media the effect of the media was so pervasive that trump supporters were generally so ridiculed and shunned that few made their views known without such dishonest illegal and oppressive tactics by the clinton side the trump vote would most certainly have been much much greater in the circumstances the clinton loss could not be more embarrassing for her her party and the msm

Robert Spencer,2016-11-04T11:07:00.000+02:00,european media jihad against geert wilders,"why time magazines joe klein is so wrong about hillary clinton rebutting the absurd claims of my namesake november   joseph klein 
time magazines joe klein has just penned an article entitled why hillary clinton is the only choice to keep america great i feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of primary colors the novel based on about bill clintons first presidential campaign in  
the other joe klein laments that hillary has been so severely damaged in the course of the year battering shes received at the hands of extremists and the media sorry but hillarys wounds are selfinflicted her lies greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for state department business while she was secretary of state and of the payforplay clinton foundation 
there is one part of trump that is indisputably real his ego the other joe klein wrote as if hillary were the epitome of humility and grace 
those who would put clintons failings in the same league as trumps depravities are delusional declared klein i agree with his statement but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain he did not hand pick hillarys word an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security let alone pick up the phone and contact ambassador chris stevens directly the government was not able to save four lives to keep four lives safe how can you keep a country safe asked stevens former fiancé in a rhetorical question that hillary would be unable to answer trump did not lie to the families of those slain in benghazi as hillary did trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government emails in order to evade the freedom of information act as hillary did 
in short anyone who thinks that hillarys proven record of recklessness mendacity and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than trumps depravities is delusional 
the other joe klein complains that trump deals in stereotypes  the blacks the hispanics the muslims the women and yes even the veterans yet much of hillarys pitch is genderbased elect her because she is a woman and she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets  deplorable racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic and  for good measure  irredeemable 
the other joe klein charges that trump is about all that has gone wrong in our society and nothing of what has gone right to paraphrase bill clinton that would depend on what your definitions of wrong and right are is hillary clinton really right when she parrots black lives matters stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white privilege and systemic racism in this country is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police brutality aimed against africanamericans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined i dont think so 
hillary also represents the political correctness and antireligious bigotry of the secular left elite that many americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society at the women in the world summit last year for example hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of americans reminiscent of president obamas contemptuous clinging to religion quote back in  
hillarys key supporters and top aides have targeted the catholic church in particular for their notion of progressive reform there needs to be a catholic spring in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church wrote sandy newman president of voices for progress in an email to clintons campaign chairman john podesta in response podesta picked up on the spring theme he wrote we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now likewise catholics united like most spring movements i think this one will have to be bottom up

Harold Hughes,2016-10-26T22:46:37.729+03:00,no title,"state that fired pastor demands his sermons notes this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority published  mins ago bob unruh about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print dr eric walsh photo first liberty 
the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church 
but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons 
walshs ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church 
lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired 
at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today 
now in response to walshs lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen 
the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest  
in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded  different categories of materials including sermons from  us 
welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons 
first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon notes all documents without even topical or time limits it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor every church every denomination and every citizen of faith in america 
leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee part of the nations largest public policy womens group with  members also came to walshs defense 
penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr eric walsh is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs 
can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share 
wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him 
no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist 
state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing 
the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up 
pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make it warm  ive thought that through its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway 
then there was laughter from both parties 
oneal then said to inform walsh youre out and there was another round of laughter 
its very funny pfirman said

new probe the fbi gives hillary clinton a second look photo illustraion wire 
fbi october surprise 
according to reports  in a letter written today fbi director james comey  stated that the fbi has begun a new probe into hillary clinton related emails once again comey offered scant details about the new probe but due to an unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server 
cnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation 
in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added 
although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded 
humas estranged sexting husband 
according to a new report released via the new york times  
the presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  in a letter to congress  the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled 
this unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a  million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another  million dollar deal scheduled over nine years 
the following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation 
the new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations  as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers  visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some  times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film  robert creamer resigns over a massive democratic party controversy image source cnn  creamer a convicted felon  in  creamer plead guilty  million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaigns inner circle following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at trump rallies pay to play virginia governor terry mcauliffe closely allied with the clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the fbi image source new republic  it remains unclear what exactly reopened the new clinton probe but perhaps the fbi had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime clinton associate  virginia gov terry mcauliffe  helped steer  to the election campaign of the wife of an fbi official who went on to lead the probe into hillary clintons use of a private email system according to a report the ny post also reported on the matter this past week 
the political action committee of mcauliffe the clinton loyalist gave  to the state senate campaign of the wife of andrew mccabe who is now deputy director of the fbi according to the wall street journal  
the report states jill mccabe received an additional  from the virginia democratic party which is heavily influenced by mcauliffe 
the money directed by mcauliffe began flowing two months after the fbi investigation into clinton began in july  around that time the candidates husband was promoted from running the washington field office for the fbi to the no  position at the bureau 
in a cnn report from october th a week before the mcauliffe revelations according to notes from interviews conducted during an fbi investigation into clintons email practices undersecretary of state patrick kennedy personally tried to convince fbi officials that the email should be declassified one interviewee described feeling pressured by another fbi official at kennedys request 
the newly reopened fbi investigation into clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the fbi received following the first clinton investigation in addition to concerns over dealings between the fbi and clinton associates  the agency needed to save face

Jason Easley,2016-11-01T02:04:45.448+02:00,trump is deadbeating on his campaign debts by refusing to pay his own pollster,"military british defense secretary michael fallon photo by afp 
british defense minister michael fallon says the uk is set to deploy hundreds of troops to the baltic region in europe to support its nato allies in the face of a more assertive russia 
fallon told a nato ministerial meeting in brussels on wednesday that britain would send  soldiers to estonia to fulfill its pledge to deliver one of four battalions to natos enhanced forward presence in eastern europe 
backed by a rising defense budget this deployment of air land and sea forces shows that we will continue to play a leading role in nato supporting the defense and security of our allies from the north to the south of the alliance fallon said 
nato had announced in july that it would deploy on a rotational basis four multinational battalions to poland and the baltic statesestonia latvia and lithuaniato deter what it referred to as any russian incursion 
during his address at the meeting fallon also said that four british typhoon fighter jets would be dispatched to romania under the nato southern air policing mission which is supposed to protect the baltic states airspace against possible attacks from russia 
this is about two things reassurance and that needs to be done with some formidable presence and deterrence fallon had said in an earlier interview this is not simply a tripwirethis is a serious military presence 
the move is likely to draw criticism from moscow which has been angered by natos military buildup on its western borders 
the usled military alliance cut its ties with moscow in  and has been reinforcing its presence near russias borders ever since 
the uk and russia have strong disagreements over a number of issues mainly the conflicts in syria and ukraine 
the two countries military forces have been involved in a series of aerial and naval confrontations with britain sending its jets and warships on several occasions to intercept russian bombers and naval fleets 
the latest of those encounters occurred on thursday when the russian aircraft career admiral kuznetsov and its sevenship task force were shadowed by two british warships on a course to sail through the north sea and english channel on their way to syria loading",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/clinton-trump-3.jpg,bias,Real,new report uncovers secret trump server repeatedly communicated russia,world leaders personal chefs sample indian market fare wed oct pm news bulletin chefs various heads state pose photograph visit spice market old quarters new delhi october afp worlds highprofile chefs india explore one gastronomic societies earth members exclusive cooking society le club des chefs des chefs gathered new delhi sample indias spicy aromatic cuisine culinary delegate comprising personal chefs worlds leaders decided hold meeting india invited countrys president got chance explore crowded alleys old delhis pungent spice market get taste countrys authentic ingredients top chefs get together every year general assembly meeting supposed provide platform gourmands exchange recipes elite chefs also discuss ways use food diplomacy connect communities club also seeks promote local food healthy eating habits,1.0

the democratic coalition against trump released a statement announcing their complaint the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
outrage is growing over comeys actions as details about the fbi investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with clinton her emails or her server 
director comeys motives for sending the letter  days before a presidential election have been questioned by both republicans and democrats 
if comeys actions were politically motivated he would be in violation of the hatch act 
what republicans initially viewed as a new hope in the presidential election has quickly been exposed as a desperately political ploy

mrs clinton has an point lead among voters who did not participate in the  election according to our estimates which are based on a combination of the poll results and voter file data she fares even better among white voters who didnt vote in  than she does among white voters who did its a pattern that has been true across all of the upshotsiena surveys in florida north carolina and pennsylvania 
there has not been an influx of new voters who might help mr trump according to our estimates mrs clinton has a point lead among newly registered voters 
the idea that trump was bringing millions of new voters to the republican party was always a myth 
donald trump got the most votes of any candidate in a republican presidential primary trump also set the record for most votes cast against in a republican primary trump is one of the few nominees in history to have a majority of his partys primary ballots cast against him 
hillary clinton is the candidate who is attracting millions of new voters and without a doubt some of those voters have been motivated by donald trumps campaign 
trump was right he has brought millions of new voters to the polls what he neglected to tell republicans is that they are coming for hillary clinton",english,naturalnews.com,http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/640/Nature/Climate-Change-Highlight-Dictionary.jpg,junksci,Fake,top toxins poisoning kids,according quinnipiac university fourway races list presidential vicepresidential candidates except georgia north carolina green party candidate jill stein ballot show georgia trump percent clintons percent percent libertarian party candidate gary johnson compares percent trump lead september iowa percent clintontrump tie percent johnson percent green party candidate jill stein trump led clinton percent september north carolina clinton edges trump percent percent johnson october clinton percent trumps percent virginia clinton tops trump percent percent johnson percent stein clinton percent september contrary republican hopes donald trumps slide stopped trump continues lose support men iowa georgia north carolina appears slipping away trump republican nominee blown leads iowa georgia trump campaign gone far admit lose florida lose election signs evident polling republican party much closer experiencing landslide winning white house november trump landslide defeat could trigger disaster republicans leads additional democratic senate pickups beyond four seats needed take back majority republicans could see current record house majority gutted clinton landslide election getting better republicans landscape getting worse polling continues another week state level democrats could looking best case scenario democratic white house house senate play,1.0

Activist Post,2016-11-02T18:25:27.690+02:00,water protectors face off with police nodapl,"by catherine j frompovich 
part  of  
the following is the testimony i will present pro se without a lawyer representing me to the pennsylvania public utility commissions administrative law court november  and   as a result of my not permitting an ami smart meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by peco an exelon company that provides electricity and service to the suburban philadelphia where i live 
this testimony addresses most of the health legal and constitutional issues plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and rfemf cancercausing technology forced on consumers along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an ami smart meter 
there are four parts to the entire testimony that was  pages long plus  pages of exhibits a thru w and other documentation i had in my brief case not presented but as backup if needed that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation published research etc 
personally i think after reading the entire testimony which will appear in four parts readers can understand whats involved with unsafe fireprone and rfemfdirty electricityproducing ami smart meters when for decades utilities provided safe nonplastic parts analog meters before the administrative law court at the pa public utility commission philadelphia pa  november     
your honor judge heep and judge pell members of the pa puc peco energy company the exelon legal team and all interested parties 
since today is the rescheduled postponed june   hearing and for which i catherine j frompovich submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules i have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous  pages  pages of testimony and  pages of exhibits a thru q that i submitted via the us postal service and which all parties received i presume 
however in view of the paramount importance plus dire consequences of emfsrfs being forced onto pennsylvania consumers with no optout for personal safety and protection from  nonionizing radiation emitted by ami smart meters microwave technology and my being a fiveyear breast cancer survivor i submit into testimony and evidence that the pa puc and all participating pennsylvania utilities not just peco as in my case must factor in the american with disabilities act amendments which redefine cancer as a disability especially since there are cancercausing effects from emfsrfs about which i submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of exhibits per the schedule of exhibits i now introduce plus printed documents i have with me in support of the fourpage bibliography of pertinent published literature regarding electromagnetic radiation cancer  ami smart meters that i also submit into the record as exhibit s  
since the ada amendments act provides for three prongs of what constitutes a disability i am submitting into evidence a printout titled americans with disability act amendments act adaaa pointing out appropriate and applicable sections exhibit a  a twopage printout titled ada amendments redefine cancer as a disability exhibit a  along with a page dossier containing about  published studies regarding breast and other cancers and emfelfrf cancer studies exhibit a  and topping off those documents with a twopage letter dated  august  from the foremost emfrf researchers physicians and academics in the world written to the north carolina utilities commission exhibit a wherein in the third paragraph they state 
smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter rfr smart meter rfr consists of frequent very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day because smart meter exposure over a  hour period can be very prolonged  pulses can average  times a day  and because there is building evidence that the sharp high intensity pulses are particularly harmful  the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters 
those five researchers david carpenter md director institute for health and the environment university of albany dr lennart hardell md phd professor department of oncology university hospital orebro sweden dr magda havas bsc phd environmental  resources studies trent university canada dr martha herbert md phd assistant professor of neurology harvard medical school pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist at the massachusetts general hospital boston dr sam milham md mph former chief epidemiologist washington state department of health 
point out in the last sentence of the first paragraph  it is imperative that the north carolina utilities commission be fully aware of the harm that rfr can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty 
frompovich respectfully points out and also cautions the pa puc that in not permitting opt outs from ami smart meters in pennsylvania during formulating its ami sm regulations since hb stated ami sms were not to be mandated  it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe ami sms regarding the rfrs they emit various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing ami sms opt outs which the pa puc deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding ami sms thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which in essence violate the nuremberg code since consumers consent was not required nor asked and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on pecos customers 
again frompovich points to the letter addressed to the ncuc exhibit a at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the us ntp june  study conclusion in part stating adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer  
frompovich further elaborates that cell phone rfr exposure is elective  ie depending upon personal choice use and an individuals ability to turn off cell phones thereby reducing andor avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and rfrs exposures both cell phones and ami sms produce 
however harmful personal bodily rfr exposure has been mandated by pa puc regulationsnot hbact   and therefore is absolutely illegal since act  does not defy nor negate the pennsylvania state constitutions inherent rights of mankind section  but its the commonwealths regulatory agencythe pa pucthat is guilty of nonfulfillment i allege 
all men and women are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property and reputation  and of pursuing their own happiness  pennsylvania constitution section  
however contrary to that pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated ami smart meter rfr exposure because of no opt outs in pennsylvania specifically via pa puc regulations not act  literally provides no way to escape andor avoid ami sms microwave rfrs that is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally frompovich contends furthermore the pa puc overstepped its agency powers and frompovich contends is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process 
the above five researchers exhibit a delineate cell phone and smart meters as basically the same animal because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum see paragraph  of their letter to the ncuc for more detail including that smart meters over a hour period can average  pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as dirty electricity  
i submit into the record exhibit a dirty electricity or dirty power and the page report why are electromagnetic fields dangerous  is dirty electricity making you sick including  charts  table  ranking electric meters and table  ranking electric meters for risk of privacy and cyber security from the page report ranking electricity meters for risk to health privacy and cyber security available online at httpswwwscribdcomdocrankingelectricitymetersforrisktohealthprivacyandcybersecurity  
the key dispute and multifaceted issue of concern in frompovichs case  being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years  is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear exposure to cancercausing emfs andor actuality of contracting cancer due to ami sm rfr exposures  in her homesomething that the ada amendments act indisputably encompass since once a cancer patient that makes frompovich covered within one of the adaaa prongs for all time and also includes frompovichs indefeasible right to protect property both her home and her personal body and its life processes including her reputation 
that federal adaaa must be factored into frompovichs case since peco has obtained federal grant monies to implement its ami smart meters rollout and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the adaaa including state regulatory agencies like the pa puc 
frompovichs refusal of an ami sm plus her human and innate right to protect her health body and property are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out  the strongest evidence for hazards coming from rfr is cancer  there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity ehs see paragraph  of the letter to ncuc exhibit a  
on page  paragraph  of that same letter the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental if not predictable  variances as per the chart i raise up and submit into the record  a doublesided poster radiofrequency research does funding matter which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics 
nonindustry studies indicate  harmful effects with  no effects while industry studies indicate   harmful effects with  no effects statistically thats almost a wash as each just about cancels the other however theres a slight edge of  from nonindustry studies indicating harmful effects more interestingly though is that industry studies did find  harmful effects studiesalmost onethird of the studies and yet the industry concludes differently stating there are none that alone should be a red flag for them or anyone of scientific mind to investigate further and they did not which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out is that a crime of omission or collusion 
paragraph  on page  of that letter exhibit a cites the obvious crux of scientific and ethical issues regarding ami smart meters in pennsylvania in particular stating with a leading nc dhhs staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance the dhhs conclusion is not surprising 
frompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred and still occurs with and from peco and the pa puc thereby illegally depriving frompovich and all pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental ami smart meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize nonthermal adverse health effects from rfrs which have been known since  i introduce exhibit t electrosensitivity es and electromagnetic hypersensitivity ehs into the record to document that in    and  various health issues have been identified with emf nonthermal exposures 
your honors i respectfully ask the court to instruct peco to produce the experimental studies rather than epidemiological studies indicating no nonthermal effects from emfsrfs wheres the science 
arent pecos customers entitled to have that evidence 
frompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following how much influence did the microwave industry contribute to pa state representative robert godshalls campaign coffers andor his preferred charities that apparently has enabled godshall as chair of the pa house consumer affairs committee to sit on opt out bills in the pa legislature for several legislative sessions including godshalls verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fireprone ami sms in pennsylvania 
heres what other us states have done regarding ami smart meters 
analog meters are definitively offered as the optout meter in four states arizona california maine and texas the nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance which clearly is the analog 
three states offer the existing meter as the optout meter an existing meter might or might not be analog georgia hawaii and consumers energy in michigan 
three states let the utility decide florida maryland and nevada the nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance which clearly is the analog 
four states or utilities definitively forbid analog optouts fountain in colorado dte in michigan central hudson valley in new york amr and port angeles in washington touted as the first place to ban smart metersnot much help you are required to have a digital meter on your home

"David Gutierrez, staff writer",2016-10-27T11:36:20.197+03:00,tasmanian devil milk is capable of killing the most deadly superbugs,"why hydrogen peroxide should be in every home 
sunday october   by david gutierrez staff writer naturalnews inexpensive nontoxic versatile and potent hydrogen peroxide is a wonder product that belongs in every homehydrogen peroxide is widely known as a disinfectant for minor cuts and scrapes but many people dont understand that it works simply by oxidizing microbes to death hydrogen peroxide is simply water with an extra oxygen atom attached in this unstable form the oxygen breaks off from the water and forms a free radical solution that is highly reactive but once it has reacted the only byproducts are nonreactive oxygen and water this is why when used properly hydrogen peroxide is so safehydrogen peroxide is so safe and effective that our own immune systems actually generate it as the first line of defense against microbes as diverse as bacteria viruses yeast and parasites in this context it also appears to act as an antiinflammatory natural remedies so how can you make hydrogen peroxide work for you unsurprisingly many of this products greatest uses are as natural cures or for some other healthpromoting function for example a nasal spray made from one tablespoon of  percent hydrogen peroxide in a cup of nonchlorinated water can be an effective treatment for sinus infections toothaches caused by minor infection can be treated with a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash the same mouthwash can also remove bad breathif you think youre coming down with a cold stave it off by placing a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in your ears each morninghydrogen peroxide is also a potent antifungal a  mix of hydrogen peroxide and water sprayed on the feet every night and allowed to dry is a good way to get rid of athletes foot and other fungal infections a similar but much more diluted cure can be used on plants suffering from fungus in this case dissolve half a cup of hydrogen peroxide in a gallon of water and spray on the affected plant replace your cosmetics you can also get lots of use from hydrogen peroxide around the home mixed with baking soda it makes a great toothpaste it can also be used to protect water that you expect to be standing for a while such as that in a humidifier or steamer  a pint of hydrogen peroxide mixed in will prevent microbial growth similarly you can use hydrogen peroxide as a toilet bowl cleaner let it sit for  minutes and then scrubwhen properly diluted hydrogen peroxide can detox your skin by stripping away harmful environmental toxins just mix  quarts of hydrogen peroxide into a full bathtub and soak for half an hour or moreother cosmetic uses of hydrogen peroxide include cleaning your contact lenses  it denatures proteins that build up on the lenses  or helping to remove ear wax buildup a few drops in the ears followed by a few drops of olive oil will cause earwax to break up and drain outhydrogen peroxide can also be used as a safer gentler alternative to bleach for lightening your hair household uses hydrogen peroxide isnt just for your body it can also be for your dogs hydrogen peroxide can induce rapid vomiting in dogs that have swallowed dangerous objects vomiting should only be induced upon a vets recommendation howeverfinally hydrogen peroxide can be great for your clothing use it instead of bleach to whiten your laundry more carefully applied it can take out organic stains by breaking apart the proteins causing the discoloration this is particularly effective with blooduse caution when applying hydrogen peroxide directly to clothing as it may bleach or discolor some fabrics but if you have a fresh organic stain you should be fine if you pour on just a small amount of hydrogen peroxide wait a few minutes it should foam and then rinse it off with cold water and soap sources for this article

  vicki batts tags vaccination  australia  medical police state naturalnews is there some sort of race to see which country can eliminate the rights of its people first it is certainly beginning to feel like there must be something going on since government overreach looks like it is reaching an alltime high across the worldwhile countries like australia demonize other nations for their lack of progressiveness recent developments suggest that its government is taking away peoples freedom to think for themselves slowly but surely chipping away at those who have dissenting opinions the evidence the newly released vaccination standards provided by the nursing and midwifery board of australia in response to what the organization described as a small number of nurses and midwives promoting antivaccination via social mediain their statement they wrote that the board was merely taking the time to make its expectations in regards to vaccination and vaccination advice very clear to registered nurses enrolled nurses and midwives the board expects all registered nurses enrolled nurses and midwives to use the best available evidence in making practice decisionsthis sentiment might have been acceptable if it wasnt coupled with the organization also prompting people to tattle on each other you see the board is also urging members of the public to come forward and report nurses and midwives who may be expounding antivaccination beliefs surely anyone who goes against the grain deserves to be punishedif the medical industry was as strictly regulated as it purports itself to be perhaps so many people wouldnt be dying each year from medical errors an estimated  to  people in australia lose their lives to medical mistakes each year  but the industry continues to insist that its those pesky thoughts that are really putting people in jeopardy how dare anyone want to help people and think for themselves at the same timein their statement the board noted that any reports will not be taken lightly the board will consider whether the nurse or midwife has breached their professional obligations and will treat these matters seriouslyto make matters worse not only will these brave nurses and midwives be reported by people who may once have been their friends or colleagues but the promotion of what the government deems misleading or deceptive information is a serious offenseand boy will they take it seriously under national law the australian health practitioner regulation agency is able to prosecute anyone who commits such an act while we all know that the true deception lies in the promotion of vaccines as a public health necessity we also know that mainstream medicine will do anything to protect their precious immunizationsdr hannah dahlen a professor of midwifery at the university of western sydney and the spokeswoman for the australian college of midwives told the guardian that nurses and midwives are respected individuals who play an important role in society and that she believes that people take their advice quite seriously she went on to say i agree that they have a very serious obligation to provide the best available evidence and it is of course concerning that some are taking to social media in order to express a position not backed by sciencebut are concerns about whats in vaccines really not backed by science many people might say that continuing to ignore the evidence that there are horrible toxins like glyphosate and mercury in vaccines is what goes against science in a rather ironic statement dahlen declared the worry is the confirmation bias that can occur because people might say there you go this is proof that you cant even have an alternative opinion it might in fact just give people more fuel for their belief systemslegislating dissenting opinions into extinction and persecuting those who are raising awareness about a very real problem is proof that alternative opinions are not allowed thats

denver co  a denver cop has been arrested and suspended without pay after his own body camera footage caught him stealing  in cash from a crash victim 
instead of helping an unconscious crash victim officer julian archuleta took advantage of the situation for his own personal gain by going through the mans clothing and robbing him archuleta now faces charges of misdemeanor theft stdegree official misconduct and tampering with physical evidence 
according to an arrest affidavit archuleta responded to a call of shots fired in the early morning hours of october  the call then led to a short pursuit which ended as the car crashed the driver got away while the passenger of the vehicle was knocked unconscious 
archuletas body camera then recorded the officer for the next  minutes and  seconds in the footage he took pictures of the scene and then searched the mans clothing which had been removed by paramedics 
in the video archuleta finds a stack of cash in the mans pants with a  bill on top according to the arrest affidavit he then separates the  bill from the stack and a  bill remains on top 
throughout the footage archuleta shuffles money and rearranges paperwork in his patrol car the affidavit said 
according to the denver post when a detective collected the cash and logged it into the property bureau as evidence he counted  and did not find any  bills the affidavit said but while reviewing archuletas body camera footage as part of the investigation the detective noticed the  bill 
amazingly enough instead of covering up the theft the detective crossed the thin blue line and reported the inconsistency with the  bill to internal affairs when confronted by investigators archuleta told them he would check his war bag to see if any of the money had slipped into a crevice in his patrol car 
according to the arrest affidavit archuleta called the detective back an hour later and claimed he found   bills that must have fallen in his bag after being caught redhanded archuleta then turned in the money 
according to the post the denver district attorneys office declined to prosecute the shooting suspect because of the missing cash and because archuleta allegedly moved evidence inside the suspects vehicle before detectives had a search warrant the affidavit said 
earlier this year the denver police department was equipped with body cameras we now know why it took so long for the department to adopt them archuleta will now go down in history as the first denver cop to be criminally charged based on body camera evidence 
like most cases of police theft this incident is not isolated in fact just  months ago grants police department sgt roshern c mckinney  was arrested after an investigation found that hed stolen both money and marijuana from the police department like archuleta he entire theft was captured on the officers own body camera mckinney has since been charged with marijuana distribution conspiracy and felony embezzlement 
state police also charged mckinneys yearold girlfriend tanicka gallegosgonzales for drug distribution and conspiracy both were arrested in albuquerque and booked into the sandoval county detention center according to kob 
public information officer for the new mexico state police elizabeth armijo said grants police chief craig vandiver alerted state police after the department found video from mckinneys lapel camera that exposed possible illicit activity by a grants police department sergeant 
what does it say about the criminal tendency of some police officers when they are unable to practice restraint from theft  knowing that they are being recorded share google  the kali whrite boi 
ok am not cool with corrupt criminal cops but still this msm puppet is infuriating this civilian was fleeing a scene of shots fired leading the cop in a short chase before crashing

the resolution deeply decries the continuous israeli aggressions against civilians including islamic religious figures and priests decries the forceful entering into the different mosques and historic buildings and into muslim holy sites by israelis including employees of the socalled israeli antiquities israel is urged to end these aggressions and abuses which inflame the tension on the ground and between faiths 
according to hillel neuer executive director of un watch a genevabased watchdog organization the resolution which is likely to be adopted dangerously risks fueling antijewish incitement and violence and legitimizing the escalating palestinian denial of jewish and cultural rights neuer added that this inflammatory narrative praised last week by hamas rewards the past years relentless palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in jerusalem and other parts of israel which we mustnt forget began with false claims that israel was planning to damage the holy muslim shrines 
the expected resolution mentions eleven times alharam alsharif the muslim designation to what jews call har habayit the holiest shrine in judaism where the temple of solomon stood and also known as temple mount with the islamic bloc controlling the largest voting bloc in the un it is no wonder that a resolution of this kind can be approved oic organization of islamic cooperation being the largest and most influential bloc at the un it might as well declare that the earth is flat and it will garner a majority vote at the general assembly or its other un constituent agencies what this resolution effectively does to jerusalem is to islamize sites historically belonging to other faiths 
the latest draft does not describe the western wall as the most hallowed remains of the jewish holy temple destroyed by the romans in ce but as the western wall of al aqsa mosque in a blatant effort to erase the jewish heritage and biblical truth and as part of a campaign to islamize the site it shamelessly disregards the fact that jewish worshippers have prayed at the wall for over two thousand years the language of the draft resolution continues the deliberate attempt by the palestinian authority pa to deny the jewish historical connection to the land of israel in general and to jerusalem in particular mahmoud abbas has continued on the path of denial that arafat initiated at camp david 
among the charges brought up by the pa and the other arabmuslim states for undertaking the resolution is that the jerusalem light rail which is used daily by thousands of arab residents of jerusalem is having a damaging effect on the visual integrity and the authentic character of the walls of the old city of jerusalem yet the rail tracks pass through an existing highway and facilitates effective transportation for visitors of all faiths 
preceding the shameless resolution and the vote that took place in the paris headquarters of unesco israels president reuven rivlin stated at an event in his jerusalem residence no forum or body in the world can come and deny the connection between the jewish people the land of israel and jerusalem  and any such body that does so simply embarrasses itself we can understand criticism but you cannot change history 
unescos director general irina bokova and the chairman of unescos executive board michael worbs expressed displeasure and apologized for the resolution in an interview with israeli tv channel  on october   the day following the vote worbs said he hoped that the boards tuesday meeting will be delayed in order to reach consensus on the resolution before a formal vote bokova on her part expressed her dismay at the resolution saying that efforts to deny history and the citys jerusalem complex multifaith character harms unesco 
earlier in july  bokova stated that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city to deny or conceal any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription in  as a world heritage site 
unesco can be counted as one of the most antiisrael un agencies in the course of a typical year the organizations legislative bodies will condemn israel  or more times with no criticism aimed at any other country in the world in  for example unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions  eight at the  st and  nd sessions of the executive board and two at the  th session of the general conference again in  unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board in  unesco again adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board and two resolutions against israel at the  th session of the general conference 
whereas jerusalem was king davids capital and continued to be the capital of the second jewish commonwealth as well as israels capital today it was never the capital of any arab or muslim empire caliphate or entity nor was jerusalem a spiritual center that muslims yearned for the umayyad caliphate had its capital in damascus the abbasside caliphate capital was baghdad and the ottoman empires caliphate capital was constantinople ramle a small town in israel was its administrative capital in palestine  not jerusalem a palestinian state never existed as an independent entity and the pa claims on jerusalem are strictly contrarian  to deny jerusalem as the heart of jewish spirituality and yearning jerusalem exists in every jewish prayer and is invoked on every occasion and holiday 
dore gold former director general of israels foreign ministry addressed last years unescos jerusalem resolution he pointed out that the resolution glossed over any jewish connection to jerusalem and it failed to acknowledge christianitys ties to jerusalem 
most dismaying is the fact that christian nations who voted for the resolution or abstained have abandoned all vestiges of pride and honor and are willing to deny historical truth for narrow political interests brazil mexico and the dominican republic predominantly catholic states are a case in point unfortunately other christian countries including france spain greece argentina and sweden who should know about jerusalem from their church bibles did not have the courage to reject this outrageously false resolution it can only lead to the conclusion that perhaps cowardice and latent antisemitism drove their decision to accept not reject this infamous resolution",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/dr_1.jpg?itok=23-8EVDd,hate,Real,selective outrage splcs antimuslim extremist list,reminders ignore trump doomed polls weve recently two object lessons worthlessness trump doomed polling saga days ago media loudly trumpeting hillarys victory inevitable polls going ignore trump focus building administration winning downticket races like last time around numbers turned around recently asked predict race answered one thing could predict media claim landslide hillary right election much likely medias interest spread fud promoting polls predict hillary win landslide creating perception voting useless republicans feel outcome futile less likely go vote scandal polling numbers history rebounding remains challenging unusual election premature panic weve seen circles unhealthy shouldnt completely ignore poll numbers neither treat inevitable weve two major lessons thats short sighted,1.0

reuters 
down a georgia country road camouflaged members of the three percent security force have mobilized for rifle practice handtohand combat training  and an impromptu campaign rally for republican presidential candidate donald trump 
how many people are voting for trump oohrah asks chris hill a paralegal who goes by the code name bloodagent 
oohrah shout a dozen militia members in response as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend 
as the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on nov  and civil unrest in the days following a victory by democrat hillary clinton 
they say they wont fire the first shot but theyre not planning to leave their guns at home either 
trumps populist campaign has energized militia members like hill who admire the republican moguls promise to deport illegal immigrants stop muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the mexico border trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be rigged and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win at least one paramilitary group the oath keepers has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud 
armed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early s fueled by confrontations in ruby ridge idaho and waco texas culminating in a militia sympathizers  bombing of a federal office building in oklahoma city that killed  people 
their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years driven by fears that president barack obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government the southern poverty law center which tracks extremist groups estimates there were  active militias last year up from  in  
in recent years armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of landuse disputes in the western united states federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in oregon 
many fear clinton would push the county further to the left 
this is the last chance to save america from ruin hill said im surprised i was able to survive or suffer through eight years of obama without literally going insane but hillary is going to be more of the same 

extremist groups emboldened 
the oath keepers a prominent antigovernment force that sent guntoting members to the  race riots in ferguson missouri called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud 
an hour south of atlanta the three percent security force started the day around the campfire taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range they whooped with approval when blasts from one members highpowered rifle knocked down a tree 
the group operates independently but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government the movement draws its name from the notion that no more than  percent of the american population fought in the revolutionary war against britain 
amid the war games hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on washington if clinton wins 
he said he doesnt want his members leading the way but they will defend the protesters if need be his group will not hesitate to act if a president clinton tries to disarm gun owners he said 
i will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen and prevent them from being disarmed and i will fight and i will kill and i may die in the process said hill who founded the militia several years ago 
trumps candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law said ryan lenz a researcher at the southern poverty law center 
prior to this campaign season these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the american political landscape he said now these ideas are legitimized 
over the past week some prominent trump supporters have hinted at violence 
if trump loses im grabbing my musket former illinois representative joe walsh wrote on twitter last week conservative commentator wayne root fantasized about clintons death while speaking at a trump rally in las vegas on sunday 
back in georgia the three percent security force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun they then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides ready for whatever may come

hillary clinton and the democrats have begun stealing the election using every underhanded tactic because its the only way she can win says clinton insider larry nichols 
shes going to lose and she knows it nichols said on the alex jones show thursday unless she can amass and pull off the biggest amount of voter fraud in the history of this country 
nichols explained that the establishment is already doing what it can to prevent an open and transparent election 
the dnc filed a lawsuit to try to force the removal of poll watchers at the polls he said why would they do that if they know theres no cheating going on why would they fight the voter id if they dont plan to have massive voter fraud 
the mainstream media and the clinton campaign are also doing everything they can up until election day to make everybody believe that the election is already over in hillarys favor nichols said

youve got to make people at the precinct prove that your vote was recorded properly he said if they cant show you proof then demand a paper ballot

admin,2016-10-27T17:44:56.416+03:00,republicans in congress are ready for hillary as they prepare for new probes into clinton foundation,"how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society 
a determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny  to save his country from postmodern collapse october   culture 
the global population in  was about one billion people today it stands at over seven times that amount with the rapidly growing populations of india and africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years readers today are well used to the idea that the global south is densely populated relative to its economic size and area but this was not always the case prior to the collapse of empire europe having undergone thorough industrialization was the most densely populated continent in the world source the world at six billion united nations   un dept of economic and social affairs population division  
europe was also where the worlds social justice movementsliberalism communism and feminismbegan overthrowing the old order of kings castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today but why did this happen why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness but instead lead to the emasculation of men the breakdown of the family and the disappearance of religion and morality 
in these series of articles i examine the root causes of this paradox what one can do about it on an individual dietary level and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level i am a strong believer in social change through individual growth and having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies i hope that others can benefit from my knowledge and similarly make themselves into solid men popular mainstream theories for social degeneration 
many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degenerationindustrialization having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature reduced their worth and attractivenessor utilityin the eyes of women relatedly others argue that technological progress which increased independence and ability for all allowed women to go their own way 
another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for disciplinerselection versus kselectionand so prosperous disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters fat off the success of their parents who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness one example of a shortsighted policy would be the feminist political movement which artificially separated woman from man by giving her through affirmative action socially harmful economic independence 
while all these explanations bear some truth none of them delve into the deeply emotional spiritual human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration why the mainstream theories are flawed 
to begin with a healthy man and a healthy woman even with modern technology at their disposal should not so substantially less love and cherish each other as seems to be the case today the proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man 
further the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoptionthe failure of google glass is the emblematic example it does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for slut culturethey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity anyone familiar with russian or japanese women who have the same technology at hand but a vastly greater sense of restraint and selfworth can attest to this fact therefore the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy although it is certainly a necessary condition credit ninaras credit moguphotos 
to briefly examine the argument that men no longer have nonfinancial utility in the eyes of women a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks or actually kills other peopleinstead being able to is sufficient 
therefore the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master man remains and will remain eternally true the change in technology and the nature of mens work is not the causal factorinstead the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman and women do not respond to weakling men 
let us examine the rk selection argument if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny this may seem like a truism today viewed through the lens of the postindustrial overpopulated paris hilton west but in societies of the past it was certainly not the caserather historically the opposite has been true the weak were poor because they were undisciplined and the strong were rich because they were disciplined the poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed 
an extreme version of this disciplinedrich mentality can be seen in modern british farmers many of whom financially wealthy and prosperous drive old beaten suvs reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures while it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate this is in my opinion a disproportionately visible symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board 
therefore i do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degenerationi view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends and not timelessly causal truthsint the population growth nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration 
having outlined and accounted for the above theories i argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that makes up the society this degeneration is caused by factors that affect the human organism on the basest level and the two primary factors are nutritional depletion of food caused by the growth of industrial agriculture which itself is made necessary by unprecedented population growth the pollution of the environment caused by industry and the introduction of unsafe technology 
according to this view it was not the boomers access to ease that made them such degenerate and irresponsible scum but rather the fact that the rapid population increase during their key developmental years meant that the growth of industrial agriculture that somewhat necessarily accompanied itthe green revolutioncreated such nutritionally sparse food that there was insufficient development of boomers brains leading to a generation of overgrown children 
further according to this theory the increased dependence on technology is not viewed as the cause of millennial autism but rather a symptom of millennial autism recent historical examples 
consider the historical path of communism which did not generally spring up in the villages this was not because the landlords were better able to control the peasants but instead because poor city dwellers even if earning a higher income than poor peasants had access to much worse food and lived in a far dirtier environment making them both mentally and physically ill the unfortunate result of insufficient mental development in a crisis situation  our aim should be to save as many leftists as possible and almost all can be 
the poor in the countryside today continue to vote conservative or liberal while the urban poor vote socialist for this same reason the rural poor despite usually being less wealthy than the urban poor are intellectually mature enough to see how harmful a controlling government can be the urban poor mostly achieve the intellectual maturity of children or adolescents and mostly feel rather than think so they support an emotionbased class war or gender war ideology 
this theory explains the early rise of social justice in europe where industrial agriculture was first adopted on a wide scale and also explains why such movements did not organically grow anywhere else until much later owing to the much later adoption of industrial agriculture it should be noted that in the countries where communist revolutions were actually successful they enjoyed no broad support but instead were able to defeat the mostly preindustrial historical governments because of these governments economic weakness and also because of extensive support by globalist or communist interests this was true in russia china and cambodia ancient historical examples 
this theory also explains the path of historical civilizationsromes case is highly instructive at its birth rome was a small collection of largely selfsufficient highly disciplined towns where the diet like in many towns of that era was a mixture of grains vegetables small farmed meats like chickens and hunted meatswhat we would call a balanced diet in this society men were the masters of their households with power of life and death over their family members while facing total responsibility for their family members behaviour only a group of strong capable and selfdisciplined individuals could sustain such a social order population of the city of rome e   million inhabitants  source wwwdavidgalbraithorg 
romes extreme martial and social discipline led to expansion as it expanded and the citys population grew the diet for most people changed over time to mostly grains farmed highly intensively shipped in from all over the empire losing a lot of its nutrition on the way simultaneously and partly as a result of rising grain production meat consumption fell reducing the populations testosterone levels leading to falling strength and willingness or ability to compete as well as rising mental illness because of copper overload 
the weakened populations increasing demands for emotion based socialism led to the growth of a massive welfare state and eventual bankruptcy hyperinflation and collapse of the central government 
india is another equally tragic example the population growth that resulted from highly prosperous nanda rule led to the growth of buddhism and the adoption of degenerate attitudes moral collapse and eventually weakness to invasion after the institutionalization of buddhism by powerhungry and utterly machiavellian psychopath ashokawho looked to weaken the brahmins hinduisms traditional moral guidesbuddhisms degenerate vegetarian curse spread like a virus and created over several generations a population of weaklings who werent again able to assert their independence for over a thousand years the song dynasty followed a similar path as these two empires being eventually overrun by the mongols the yuan dynasty population of china  source vaclab smil chinas environmental crisis  
this degradation of the diet caused by population growth has been at least a significant causal element behind the degeneracy and collapse of most prosperous sedentary civilizations the modern context 
the dramatic increase of the population since ancient times should help you understand why humans today are such fools and weaklings compared to our ancestors there is only so much nutrition in the worlds topsoil to go around and a population seven times greater than  years ago eating a diet uncorrected through nutritional supplementation for dietary sparsity will be living individually in effect  th the life that its ancestor population did is it any wonder that people today feel so weak and helpless that they want mommy government and daddy police state to give them the illusion of comfort and security 
this theory is also borne out in the data in general food today contains ½ to  th the nutrients it did in the s which was already about  years after the adoption of modern style industrial agriculture in the west this dramatic fall in nutrition has accompanied the tripling of the global population and closeto doubling of the european population since that time while some population control seems necessary i believe that sustainable organic agriculture combined with nutritional supplementation should obviate a large amount of needed population reduction 
i hope that the reader is after consideration of these facts sufficiently convinced of the true causes behind the modern worlds degeneracy people have fairly universally across the political spectrum become weak and insane from malnutrition artificial protein may have allowed some men to grow muscles and calcium from an overreliance on milk may have allowed them to grow tall but perhaps the lack of most necessary nutrients has meant that they are generally still retarded emotionally spiritually and intellectually the effects on modern society 
this weakness amongst menand dietary sparsity has disproportionately affected men due to our much greater nutritional requirementshas not just resulted in an inability to control the destructive forces that lie latent in every society worse the fundamental outlook of men who viewed themselves as the creators of civilization the slayers of enemies and the protectors of women all under god has changed the modern millennial man is a childlike hedonist who cares little for his civilization culture or people an aspiring patriarch an example of testicular failure image credit giorgiomtbshutterstock environmental toxins 
environmental toxins are also a problem electrical oestrogen and toxic metal pollution are underresearched but may have devastating effects on human health radio waves plastics unfiltered medication and purposely added toxins in the water supply like fluoride and chlorine have deleterious effects too what can we do 
considering these realities it serves little purpose to blame women for their selfdestructive behavior while in the past like men women used to have enough emotional maturity to try to live a life of selfrespect for example by remaining virgins and not drinking alcohol they have never had much agency charisma or true self will even before the diet was empty and before they were being stuffed full of drugs and chemicals by the unscrupulous pharmaceutical industry and its proxies 
these poisons may cause serious and dangerous although slowly fixable hormonal and behavioral changes but the real effects are felt by their offspring unfortunately once a woman is hooked on these drugs for example the birth control pill or antidepressants she is unlikely to come off them and if she does she is unlikely to do anything to fix the damage to herself or her future children this is especially the case as the medical industry which has brainwashed her to see doctors and the state as her loving protectors is unlikely to recommend it 
even so these drugs dont permanently alter the fact that women as mostly emotion driven actors are biologically and intrinsically people pleasers and respond automatically to the most powerful person or group of people that can give them a raison dêtre even if we cant ensure that women in general improve their diet and avoid pollutants we can certainly make changes on an individual level convincing or browbeating our girlfriends sisters and mothers 
the healthier a woman gets the greater her affinity with nature becomes and the more maternal she feels so you can be fairly certain that shell try and pass on the knowledge to her children and friends like our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers did furthermore there are a large minority of health conscious women who it should be our duty to marry and impregnate as many times as possible considering the rapid population declines that will occur in the atheist and leftist segments of our countries native populations these women are our best hope for creating a viable future you will have to teach her a few things credit csp_subbotina the situation is not hopelessbut we have a fight on our hands 
in the past wellinformed people couldnt expect due to the limited and elitecontrolled nature of communication technology and the educational system to make any impact on the vast majority of the population the political fight against big agra and big pharma seemed hopeless today is different the growth of the internet and the increasing spread of awareness has meant that more people are aware about the importance of eating well avoiding environmental dangers and supplementing wisely 
this is partly evidenced by the steadily rising percentage of people who eat organic diets and the booming supplement industry i hope that in the future at least a significant portion of us can survive in a sane enough state to politically fight back against moves by globalists islamists communists and ruthless financiers who are circling like vultures over our degenerating civilizations 
on the other side of this political battle the globalist controlled medical industry has been the biggest proponent of unhealthy diets and dangerous and addictive drugs special interests have also been the biggest corrupters of regulators and the institutions created to defend the population against industrial and chemical pollution 
a system of global monopoly wealth extraction is not possible with active capable and selfconfident masculinities from proud nationstates to resist it those who seek to benefit from such a monopoly system have tried their absolute hardest to suppress natural health information but so far they have failed and the situation is only improving so there is considerable reason for hope conclusion 
our forefathers demanded to fulfill their destiny ordained by the gods to defend our civilizations against the forces of rapacious greed and murderous atheistic villainyto be the protectors and kings of our people today most men are mentally ill and have become childish hedonistic narcissists as expected the ruthless and soulless have exploited this weakness for their own benefit now that you have i hope understood the principles behind why most of us have lost the urge to fight to protect our cultures the cause and fix to the industrial malaise should no longer seem out of reach or impossible to grasp 
this area of the human condition is just one another where we stand at the crossroads of history but in my opinion it is the most important if the dietary trend of the last two centuries is not reversed and the nutritional quality of at least a significant minority of men is not substantially improved then each generation of people will become more communist more feminist and more weak than the last and the globalist special interests that seek to create a totalitarian worldmonopoly police state will win regardless of temporary political victories 
each of us has chosen a path to follow in our quest for spiritual intellectual and national salvation this is mine in my future articles i will detail the best dietary approach for strong men and beautiful women to follow and overview the most important environmental precautions we must take in our quest to fix the root causes of modern degeneracy 
i hope that ultimately you are convinced to help me and others like me prevent our world from collapsing entirely into a miserable cyberpunk dystopia oct   kshatriya

clashes have erupted outside south africas parliament as police struggled to disperse students protesting against financial hardships and the deteriorating economic situation in the country 
the protest on wednesday outside the national assembly building in cape town saw a direct confrontation between the police and about  students 
the protesting students were mainly angry at the increased tuition fees in the universities they also voiced anger at south africas grim economic prospects 
other cities across the country have seen similar protests over the past weeks some of them violent officials in cape town johannesburg and elsewhere have even ordered the temporary closure of the universities to calm down the situation an injured student is helped by classmates during a protest outside the parliament in cape town south africa october   photo by reuters 
the clashes on wednesday came as finance minister pravin gordhan delivered a speech in the parliament to warn about south africas weakening economy although he vowed that the government would do anything to help students in the country cope with financial problems 
we will do everything that is possible to regain normality on our campuses we want the violence to stop gordhan said adding many students face financial hardships that undermine their ability to succeed academically 
gordhan said south africas  growth forecast stood at  percent he also stated that an extra  billion rand  billion would be earmarked for funding university students 
he warned that a growing sense of political uncertainty in south africa could seriously harm the countrys financial position in the world 
much more disturbing and more difficult is the rise in our own communities of anger and discontent spilling over into violence and destructive protests gordhan said adding it is not just that our economic outlook is distressed and there is the possibility of downgrades in credit ratings 
gordhans promise of spending cuts and fighting corruption has triggered a new political standoff in south africa he has been ordered to appear in court on november  to face charges of fraud in what many see as a direct clash between him and people loyal to president jacob zuma the minister enjoys a good deal of public support over his record in office

Allen Mendenhall,2016-10-29T02:08:58.551+03:00,ideas make us rich," competing theories on why the fbi reopened the hillary email server investigation the fbi normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation american thinker   
there is no question that reopening the fbi investigation into hillary clintons email server is a big deal the fbi normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation nbc reports 
the fbi is reviewing a new batch of hillary clinton emails bureau director james comey said in a letter to the senate judiciary committee on friday 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he wrote 
the very first thing to note is that comey made no mention of a grand jury the emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation if that is the case further subpoenas are quite possible a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date 
there are  competing theories as to why he might be doing this now that come to mind he might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the fbi is substantial three days ago american thinker published an open letter from a retired fbi agent hugh galyean that laid out some of the damage comey has inflicted on the institution he leads there is little doubt that this reached many in the fbi family putting in print what people have only whispered about if those silenced voices start speaking out comey could face a serious loss of face in this scenario he is heading off a staff rebellion possibly including mass resignations rush limbaugh today discussed an alternative theory that by announcing an fbi investigation resuming comey is putting a lid on further attention to wikileaks i guess this means that clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete after the election before speaking about what the evil russians are planting into our politics it is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election in this scenario comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed and that he would be held accountable after it comes out this scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis involving the possible indictment of a presidentelect before an election or the evidence being turned over to the house of representatives for impeachment hearings

Alex Ansary,2016-11-04T22:44:05.359+02:00,analyst most americans like neither candidate,"feds warn nyc officials about possible al qaeda attack  
new york post 
new york city law enforcement authorities are on high alert after receiving a warning by the feds about a possible attack by al qaeda on the eve of election day sources said 
us intelligence officials alerted joint terrorism task forces of the threat which also included texas and virginia  though specific sites targeted for monday in the three states were not mentioned a federal source told the post 
mayor bill de blasio said friday he had learned of the threat several days ago during classified briefings 
we are still very much assessing the credibility it is not at all clear how credible this is de blasio told wnycs brian lehrer on his weekly radio show were certainly in a vigilant position 
hizzoner said the nypd is planning an extraordinary police presence for tuesday when americans go to the polls 
for the first time in memory there will be two presidential campaigns having their victory celebrations in new york city on tuesday night he said quickly correcting himself that only one candidate will be celebrating 
donald trump the republican nominee will be at the new york hilton midtown on sixth avenue while hillary clinton his democratic counterpart will be at the javits convention center across town on th avenue 
police also will be heavily deployed for the new york city marathon on sunday de blasio said 
meanwhile gov andrew cuomo declined to confirm the threat friday but also noted the high state of alert for election day 
we have more state police more national guard more soldiers on duty than ever before he said so the bad news is new york is often a threat the good news is weve been dealing with this now for over a decade and we have prepared for it 
the nypd and the port authority of new york and new jersey said they had been alerted to the possible attacks 
we are aware of the information we have been working with the fbi through the joint terrorism task force and our counterterrorism and intelligence bureaus the nypd said in a statement 
we continue to encourage anyone with any information that could be relevant to the safety of our city to contact law enforcement the department said 
the port authority  which operates airports tunnels and bridges in and around the big apple  said it too was prepared 
we are continuing the high level of security we have had in place at all of our facilities for many months spokesman steve coleman told the post 
the fbi did not comment specifically about the threat against the three states but said counterterrorism and homeland security authorities remain vigilant and wellpostured to handle attacks

cnn commentator angela rye on wednesday blamed the failure of republicans to repeal and replace obamacare for the newly announced doubledigit premium increases in the presidents signature health care law 
its not just hillary clinton that needs to tackle this but also congress rye said on cnns new day the reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly alisyn is because republicans fell short of their promise to repeal which is what they said they wanted to do and replace 
host alisyn camerota stopped rye before she got any further and reminded her that president obama had promised premiums would go down 
most states will see health care premiums under the affordable care act increase by an average of  percent according to data released this week by the obama administration indiana will see its rates slightly go down but other states like arizona will see costs skyrocket by  percent members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans   ",english,prisonplanet.com,http://static.infowars.com/images/INFOWARS_stacked.jpg,conspiracy,Fake,election theft texas,rt october number wild animals earth could fall twothirds years according new report places blame destruction habitats hunting pollution forecast could lead major consequences humans living planet report says animal losses track reach percent years reports authors also took consideration recent trend animal population decline citing percent plummet researchers analyzed changing presence monitored populations vertebrate species mammals birds fish amphibians reptiles among according paper biggest cause plummeting animal populations destruction wilderness areas farming logging pollution also mentioned significant problem vaccineladen mms distributed via drone endangered ferrets httpstcowmduucnxn pictwittercomafxrag humanitys misuse natural resources threatening habitats pushing irreplaceable species brink threatening stability climate said wwfs director science mike barrett v e r e e n animals across planet expected affected however rivers lakes hardesthit areas barrett noted global warming exacerbating pressures longer small world big planet big world small planet reached saturation point stockholm resilience centers professor johan rockström said foreword report decline wildlife along climate change part proposed notion anthropocene term suggests new era humans managed significant global impact earths geology ecosystems notion yet officially approved term used explain geological time lead major consequences richness diversity life earth fundamental complex life systems underpin life supports life part equation lose biodiversity natural world life support systems know today collapse wwf directorgeneral marco lambertini said quoted guardian fact report states humans could anything happy forecast comes fruition noting predicted situation could provoke serious competition increased human pressure threatens natural resources humanity depends upon increasing risk water food insecurity competition natural resources report states however appear hope species beginning recover suggesting conservation efforts could help tackle crisis however barrett noted order efforts take place society must largely change consumes resources youd like think nobrainer business consuming raw materials products way sustainable inevitably eventually put business barrett said report certainly pretty shocking snapshot added hope though dont throw hands despair time despair crack act remain convinced find sustainable course anthropocene new report comes less two months similar analysis found earth lost onetenth wilderness sites since early,0.0
Dawn Perlmutter,2016-11-01T07:32:55.132+02:00,the antipolice epidemic,"time investigating hillary is an attack on all women november   
good morning its tuesday 
whos up for another silly attempt to claim that hillary clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because shes a woman this gem comes from robin lakoff a berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading 
hillary clintons emailgate is an attack on women 
its not about emails its about public communication by a woman 
i am mad i am mad because i am scared and if you are a woman you should be too emailgate is a bitch hunt but the target is not hillary clinton its us 
the only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female can you imagine this happening to a man 
his name was general petraeus thank you have a nice day 
clinton is guilty of swf speaking while female and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what shes doing and must be punished for the sake of all decent women everywhere there is so much of that going around 
that escalated quickly and incoherently also im pretty sure its not the s or whatever decade robin is parodying or channeling but yes hillary clinton is only in this mess because shes a woman it has nothing to do with anything else that must be why albright and rice werent in the center of similar scandals 
if the candidate were male there would be no scolding and no scandal those very ideas would be absurd men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech in theory so do women but that as the creationists like to say is only a theory 
emailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech its illegal for both public officials of both genders 
but heres hillary rodham clinton the very public standin for all bossy uppity and ambitious women here are her emails and since its a woman doing what decent women should never doengaging in highlevel public communicationwell there must be something wrong with that even if we cant quite find that something

Ari Lieberman,2016-11-04T11:06:00.000+02:00,obamas weighs options for his final stab at israel,"the unraveling of hillarys corrupt sphere of influence november   michael cutler 
the  elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from fbi director james comey on friday october   as reported by nbc news on october  th   fbi obtains warrant for newly discovered emails in clinton probe  as reid accuses comey of hatch act violation  once again the clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond unconventional indeed tom clancy could not have scripted this years presidential election and intrigues 
while comeys recent remarks regarding the clinton investigation have been extremely vague the issue to focus on is how hillarys use of a private computer server private email account and nonsecure digital devices to store send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception 
the current focus of the clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information if that laptop had been hacked both weiner and abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail this was an issue raised by congressman louie gohmert texan republican and former judge in a fox news business interview on october   in a segment that was posted under the title  rep gohmert clinton is a potential victim of blackmail  
additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these emails as well a chain is as strong as its weakest link the weak links begin with hillary clinton and huma abedin and may now include anthony weiner and perhaps others meanwhile there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are out there petrified that wikileaks or perhaps a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the clintons or their foundation 
could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well 
lets take a moment to understand how all of this began 
just months earlier hillary clinton had been let off the hook by an fbi director who in his official statement on july    included this excerpt to be clear this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences to the contrary those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions but that is not what we are deciding now 
by comeys own words anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently this raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why comey did not see fit to take comparable action with ms clinton 
comeys ultimate decision to not present the case to a grand jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security 
however perhaps comeys hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch less than one week before the fbi director conducted that press conference on june   abc news reported  us attorney general loretta lynch bill clinton meet privately in phoenix before benghazi report  
that article served as a predication for my article  loretta lynchs private meeting with bill clinton prior to release of benghazi report  why would the attorney general who sets the tone for law enforcement do this 
as attorney general lynch is fbi director comeys boss 
at the time of this meeting the justice department was not only investigating hillarys illegal use of a private email server nonsecure personal digital devices but was also conducting an investigation into the clinton foundation 
in fact on october   breitbart reported  clinton foundation fbi investigation confirmed by former assistant fbi director  therefore bill clinton was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the attorney general to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren 
however just days after that meeting news organizations reported that hillary was contemplating keeping lynch on as attorney general if she won the election 
on july   newsmax reported  ny times clinton weighs keeping lynch as attorney general if she wins  hillarys statement that she might keep lynch on as attorney general could have provided the incentive for lynch to go along to get along 
indeed lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as i described in my commentary  loretta lynch same as the old boss  the attorney general nominees disturbing views on us immigration law 
my article included an excerpt from a yahooap news report attorney general nominee defends obama immigration changes here is the exchange in which lynch discussed the administrations immigrations policies lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem of illegal immigration she said the homeland security department was focusing on removals of the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us pressed by sen jeff sessions of alabama a leading immigration hardliner she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned however when sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job lynch replied the right and the obligation to work is one thats shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response under later questioning by democratic sen chuck schumer of new york lynch clarified it stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status 
this was disturbing and telling clearly ms lynchs views on immigration and likely therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals 
as attorney general lynch directs the operations of the entire justice department and all those who work for that department ms lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective 
however lynch and the others who have fallen under hillary clintons corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in hillarys web of deception having fallen victim to the hillary virus throughout clintons many decades in american politics this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable it is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/oc.jpg?itok=bdEqmsW_,hate,Real,time magazines joe klein wrong hillary clinton,nbcs baghdad bob fbi investigation hillary november daniel greenfield remember hillary clinton insisting fbi investigation security review even fbi rejected claim well andrea mitchell nbcs baghdad bob isnt giving claim easily even rest clinton clique screeching fbi investigating hillary like bats nether regions leftwing hell mitchell sticking old spin fbi investigation hillary close eyes say three times fbi investigating hillary complete state denial thursday msnbc host andrea mitchell interrupted live coverage donald trump speaking florida campaign rally supposedly factcheck candidate citing bombshell report fbi conducting extensive investigation hillary clintons email charitable foundation scandals mitchell refused accept reality lot factchecking shes criminal investigation fact investigation review emails lie fbi according james comey grounds prosecute lies theres criminality fretted dont know even startbut mean put context context defending hillary clinton become mental illness wrote earlier week fact checking become media term insisting primacy alternate reality even flies face actual reality fbi investigation hillary anyone believes probably sort rightwinger listens fbi actually says rather nbc says fbi says,1.0

sunday october   by j d heyes tags tainted food  organic label  china naturalnews the chinese food production industry is one of the worlds leastregulated and most corrupt as has repeatedly been proven time and again now it appears there is no trusting anything that comes from china marked organic natural health  reports that several foods within the country are so contaminated that chinese citizens dont trust them whats more the countries that import these tainted foods are putting their citizens at riskus customs personnel often turn away food shipments from china because they contain unsavory additives and drug residues are mislabeled or are just generally filthy some chinese food exporters have responded by labeling their products organic though they are far from itthere are several factors at play which make chinese claims of organic unreliable first environmental pollution from unrestrained and unregulated industrial growth has so polluted soil and waterways with toxic heavy metals that nothing grown in them is safe much less organic also there is so much fraudulent labeling and rampant corruption within the government and manufacturing sectors that its not smart to trust what is put on packagingin fact farmers in china use water that is replete with heavy metals natural health  noted in a separate report  in addition water used for irrigation also contains organic and inorganic substances and pollutants chinese organic food is so contaminated that a person could get ill just by handling some of it dirty water is all there is the report noted furtherthis is reality  all of chinas grains vegetables and fruits are irrigated with untreated industrial wastewater the yellow river which is considered unusable supports major food producing areas in the northeast provincesmany chinese farmers wont even eat the food they produce if you can believe that thats because its clear that chinas water pollution issues are so pronounced that it threatens the countrys entire food supply chinese farmers have said there is no available water for crops except  dirty water  as part of the countrys industrial prowess it is also one of the largest producers and consumers of fertilizers and pesticides water politics reportedthe site noted further that as chinas industrial might grows so too does the level of contaminants in the countrys water supply lakes rivers streams and falling water tables are becoming more polluted by the yearin addition to manmade pollutants animals produce about  percent of the organic pollutants and half of the nitrogen in chinas water  say experts at the chinese academy for environmental planning there are times when water is so polluted it turns black  yet it is still used to irrigate crops and of course that affects socalled organic farming operations as wellthese nine foods are particularly vulnerable to becoming tainted natural health  noted fish some  percent of the tilapia sold in the us come from fish farms in china  as well as half the cod water pollution in china is a horrible problem so any fish grown there are suspect chicken poultry produced in china is very often plagued with illnesses like avian flu apples and apple juice only recently has the us moved to allow the importation of chinese apples though american producers grow plenty for the country and the world rice though this is a staple in china and much of the rice in the us comes from there some of it has been found to be made of resin and potato mushrooms some  percent of processed mushrooms come from china salt some salt produced in china for industrial uses has made its way to american dinner tables black pepper one chinese vendor was trying to pass off mud flakes as pepper green peas phony peas have been found in china made of
